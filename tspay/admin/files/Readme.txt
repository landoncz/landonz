Hello!  You should have right clicked on me and clicked "Save As" to save the file,
otherwise your browser may try to open me up, which may or may not be what you wanted.

If you need to edit or rename a file, the easiest way is just to delete
the file and upload it again.

You don't have to fill out a description for the file, if the name/description field
is left blank, the portal will fill that info in with the actual file name.

Try not to have any weird spaces in your file names.  Spaces are ok, but not encouraged.
A great way to name files is to "useHungarianNotationLikeThis.doc"

Enjoy!
