<div style="overflow: auto;">I really could use everyone&#8217;s help. </p>
<p>As of January 26th, 2009 Amy and I decided to leave MD Anderson. None of the treatments used seemed to work as we had hoped and my lymphoma had been growing back as furiously and aggressive as in the very beginning. I felt like I had lost my momentum to my cure by going to MD Anderson at all. It is a machine of an institution, I felt like a number, and that my case wasn&#8217;t important enough to really seek options outside of the box. My Oncologist seemed to work just hard enough in order to avoid Amy and I speaking to patient advocacy. </p>
<p>One Sunday even as my lymphoma was growing by the day I knew I was waiting for my counts to regain in order to try yet another type of treatment. It was called R-Gemox. This was normally used for different types of &#8216;C&#8217; words, but somehow was thrown out as a possible options with new drugs to try that my body may not be so resistant to. I woke up to a little bit of excretion happening from my site and was extremely nervous. I called the hospital all day starting at 11am (5 times total) in order to let the on call doctor know so I could determine whether to go in to ER or not. Not until 9pm did I finally receive a call back from my doctor&#8217;s nurse. That was only because we had to get an Admin involved. She told me that we did not need an infection and that I may need to admit myself into the ER and have cultures done. We thought this was the best plan so we went in that next day hoping to start treatment a little early.</p>
<p>I sat in the ER for hours while they contacted the Lymphoma doctor on call. My doctor was conveniently on vacation yet AGAIN as it was Martin Luther King&#8217;s birthday and a holiday for all outpatient clinics. I have never experienced a facility that takes so much time off. I was finally sent up the Lymphoma floor and admitted into a room. Amy and I waited, and waited, and waited thinking I would start treatment immediately because my blood counts were in perfect standing. That was a mistake because due to the fact we cried possible infection the treatment could not start until the cultures came back negative. It was smart but discerning for me considering that this tumor was not getting any smaller. </p>
<p>As of Wednesday that same week I finally got started with my treatment. I was genuinely excited but started to experience some swelling of my throat. I could breath through my nose fine but woke up in a panic as I found myself with a constant flem catch in my air passage. It wasn&#8217;t a snore but a gurgle. I was pacing in the room about every two hours not sure what to make of it. I have never been this nervous for my life this whole time. Amy woke up and tried to comfort me but did not realize the magnitude of the situation. I decided to breath through and calm myself down so I could sleep. It was a true test that I was not even sure I could conquer.</p>
<p>The next morning I couldn&#8217;t swallow even a cup of water. It literally came back up as I thought I might choke. I couldn&#8217;t eat either and was freaking out. I tried to tell the nurse on staff but she just kept asking me the dumbest questions as if it was not registering what was wrong. I could barely talk. As if that was not an indication. The worst moment was when I finished my chemotherapy there were about five Oncologist that came into my room and were staring blank at me(this is a common thing there). One was even a chairman of the lymphoma department. He said he was ready to doscharge me as I finished my treatment that morning. I looked at him like he was crazy. I said, I can barely talk right, my throat is completely swollen, I cannot drink or eat. Why the hell would he send me home?? He did not see it as a problem so I had to make it a problem. He decided to get an ENT involved to inspect my throat. </p>
<p>The ENT specialists put a scope through my nose which was a strange feeling and ordered a CT Scan of my head only. Apparently adema had been building up around my throat because my lymph nodes were clogged and unable to pass any fluid through. They put me on a high dose steroid that night via IV drip. I woke up feeling like a million bucks but was not out of the fire just yet because my neck was still heavily swollen. Although I could eat, drink, and talk so that was a step in the right direction. </p>
<p>I was finally discharged and given an oral steroid to keep reducing the swelling. I was happy to be home but my tumor was not shrinking by any means from treatment. I was so discouraged but felt there has to be something else we can try. I mean really the goal is to at least get my lymphoma under control enough to throw me in to my stem cell transplant. I have had amazing response to chemotherapy before so what was going wrong? Everything since we left Pensacola just felt wrong. From the treatment, to the neglect, to the scheduling,..something just wasn&#8217;t right. This is a state of the art facility and world renowned for its progressive nature. Why was I slipping through the cracks? Why did I feel unimportant in my case?</p>
<p>That following Monday we met with my Oncologist. It was a meeting that gave Amy and I our answer but that was not such a good thing. She basically told me I was running out of options and if we felt home would be a better place to be then she understood. I couldn&#8217;t believe it,&#8230;she basically said, &#8216;I give up.&#8217; She did the whole rub on the back, sympathy at a distance. Amy had these print outs of other possible drugs and clinical trials and wanted to hand them to the doctor simply to acknowledge the possibility. She would not even take them from Amy&#8217;s hand to read through. This was so disrespectful. Dr Sunnenberg in Pensacola always encouraged our proactive nature and really worked hard to find us answers. Of course that&#8217;s when I was so close to remission too. At that point Amy looked her dead in her eye and said,&#8217;We thank you for your honesty.&#8217; She did not know how respond but still nodded her head as if she got what Amy meant by that. </p>
<p>We left feeling more lost than ever. We had a decision to make and MD Anderson was leaving us any choice. We knew for a fact home in Pensacola we had an amazing man that truly had an invested interest in my cure. We also had a few friends that were constantly searching for answers. Bijan and our friend Robbie are just the most amazing people. Both Burkitt&#8217;s survivors and ready to fight with me still. Robbie had been talking our Oncologist at Emory University Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta keeping him posted on my situation. While in the meantime Bijan was searching for clinical trials to help find ew drugs on the market I could try. Amy and I were on the phone for two days straight. If MD Anderson would not prove themselves then we knew another facility would. Dr Flowers at Emory called and gae us a sense of peace. He had ideas that nobody else were presenting to us and was ready to bring me in and try. He also knew he could coordinate them with Dr Sunnenberg in Pensacola so we knew home was the place we needed to be. It just felt right.</p>
<p>In an instant, Amy and I packed up and left our dear friends Brent and Leslie. It was so abrupt and uncertain but just felt necessary considering that Monday morning meeting. I called Jill at MD Anderson, one of the APN&#8217;s and told her we had to go. She was very helpful in how we could obtain my records and images to bring back. We were also set up for our first meeting with Dr Hosing(my stem cell transplant doctor). The day we were going to leave neck just did not look good as if it were swelling yet again. There was so much to do at MD Anderson but time was against us so we just left. </p>
<p>On the way home I got a phone call from another one of my Oncologist&#8217;s nurses about us leaving. I told her that I apologize for the immediate action and that we appreciated my doctor&#8217;s help but knew we could get more options back in Pensacola. I kid you not when that conversation shifted everything. Not twenty minutes later I got a call from my doctor at MD Anderson. I apologized again, but explained our meeting Monday gave Amy and I the answer we needed to leave and seek treatment somewhere else. I was disappointed in having to make such a rash decision but it obviously changed the dynamic completely of my situation. My doctor said she had been searching clinical trials for me!!! I was shocked. She said she found some and was emailing the doctors conducting them for me and would inform Dr Sunnenberg as soon as she heard back. Amy and I both cried. Things were finally coming together from MD Anderson. All because we left. I cannot determine if her colleagues put some pressure on her, or if her hands were not tied to them any longer due to our decision. All I know is she finally was stepping outside of the box and the machine that is MD Anderson. We drove home faster than we  could ever imagine just to get back to Pensacola so Dr Sunnenberg could see what was going on. We literally just showed up on his doorstep. </p>
<p>I wanted to kiss the ground regardless of how bad things have gotten. There is just something about home that I just missed. Rightfully so. Shit went all wrong out at MD Anderson. There were just too many hands in the pot and protocols that nobody was willing to budge on for my LIFE. As usual, even in th darkest moment Dr Sunnenberg was not even phased. He was ready to see my cure through once again even if that meant calling Dr Flowers and Dr Fanale out at MD Anderson to coordinate something else to try. Amy and I went back to our piece of heaven at home and felt empowered again. It&#8217;s just that sense of peace when you are with a doctor that is open minded and willing to fight just as hard as you are. </p>
<p>I was a little nervous about swelling though and my steroids were a taper so that meant I would take less and less each day. Apparently, that was not effective. Sure enough I woke up at 4am close to no being able to swallow or eat again. I was in pain from the tumor spreading around my temple, jaw, and neck and did not want to let this thing get out of hand again. So, as opposed to a 35 mile drive we simply got into our car and drove,&#8230;oh, 2 minutes down the road to the ER. I was admitted into our local hospital and started on steroids immediately.</p>
<p>I am in my room and get a call from Peter, Dr Fanale&#8217;s direct APN. He was spouting off about this clinical trial they found for me at MD Anderson!!! I was thrown off, scared, unsure, but was also being told I needed to go in for couple tests to get started. It was our answer!! I emailed Dr Sunnenberg, got a call from one of the nurses involved in the trial to get more details about the drugs used and requirements, and in a matter of like 6 hours I was making plans to drive BACK to MD Anderson of all places! Among Dr Flowers, Dr Sunnenberg, and Dr Fanale, all agreed this was a smart thing to do. I thought to myself, the intention was to be cured at MD Anderson so I guess that is where we need to be again.</p>
<p>Amy and I were and still are ecstatic. On top of it all my beautiful family surprised me by coming down to Pensacola. My mom, sister, and dad just got on the road and left to be with us! This has to be the answer. It just does. Amy and I have endured so uch over this year and we are so close to my cure. I know things seem to get really intense with me(it&#8217;s always just been that way) but they always work out for the best. As of right now, we are driving out to Houston early Sunday morning, I have a couple tests Monday, and if all is well then I go int this trial already by Wednesday!</p>
<p>This is where I am asking all of the amazing support from you as you have been so great before and in this case I really need the focus solely to go along these lines:</p>
<p>1. My heart function must be above 48%<br />2. This treatment HAS to put in me into remission and get me into my stem cell transplant&#8230;it must be this way<br />3. And my stem cell transplant needs to happen ASAP</p>
<p>Please keep me in your prayers this week and try to focus on the fact this WILL work. I know I am manifesting this and have asked Amy and our family to leave all doubt aside and believe in this being my cure. I want to tell you all that I love you dearly&#8230; friends, strangers, etc. Your comments and guest book entries have carried us so far and this is where we find success in my journey. Have a beautiful weekend and I will keep you posted with total updates of success.</p>
<p>To Robbie, Bijan, Cheryl, Kevin, and Kyler&#8230;this is it! Thank you so much for your search, your support, and giving me so much hope as you have from surviving. We found my cure.</p>
<p>Love,<br />Christopher &#038; Amy</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">I am sitting at MD Anderson&#8230;waiting as usual.   It seems that is all we do these days is wait and wait.  Chris is going to start a new chemo in the next few days&#8230;everything is contingent on his counts.  It is called GEM-P with Rituxin.  This particular chemo is specific to refractory lymphomas&#8230;both hodgkins and non hodgkins.  He will be admitted for 3 days.  We thought this would possibly be an out patient regime but just found out yesterday that he will be in the hospital for this one.  It&#8217;s only three days which is nothing for Chris.  He even said yesterday&#8230;that this would be a piece of cake.   He has a team of lymphoma specialist that are working for him.  they are all discussing his case&#8230;presenting it to different boards and gathering info like crazy.  We really trust his care team.<br />
Chris is doing well. He had  a rash all over his head and arms and a little on his chest.  It was infected hair follicles.  He said it was uncomfortable the first few days but has cleared up nicely.  He has been on steroids the last few days to help with swelling.  He takes about 10 a day and can effect his patience level and his overall mood.  these are all minor things to him though.  His attitude is still amazing and we are keeping our eye on the prize&#8230;which is stem cell transplant.<br />
He has cord blood ( from infants) ready for him but the problem with cord blood is that it doesn&#8217;t have as much Graph versus Tumor effect because it is such a new immune system.   The Cord Blood is powerful stuff and has worked well for leukemia and aids&#8230;so it is still a great option They are still searching for adult blood in the system everyday and he has over 100 potential matches.<br />
So much has happened since I last updated.  And I apologize for not keeping you all informed.  I have decided to not update as much and touch on the most important factors in our journey.  I feel it&#8217;s important for others who search the internet for answers to learn from Chris and from our journey.<br />
We love living with Brent and Leslie.  We live a full life here in Houston and stay busy most of the time.  We miss our friends&#8230;.  Who we do not get to see often at all, due to travel and being here in TX.</p>
<p>So that is all for now.  I will keep you all posted about this new chemo treatment.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Amy</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Okay, so I tried to actually update MY own journal for once and after numerous &#8216;continued session&#8217; attempts ultimately I made the mistake of not copying what I wrote before I tried to save the information. No update was made and it had kicked me out of the administrative section before it was too late and everything I wrote was lost. I know this is a big shock for me to update the journal for once but I wanted to give Amy a break. It seems each day is such a rush of emotions and recording it can have its drawbacks of reliving those struggles(if any).</p>
<p>Amy went home to Pensacola after my first treatment here at MD Anderson so she could see our friends and work. She was very reluctant to leave me but knew it was necessary to get back to a semi normal life if even for a short period of time.</p>
<p>She got a chance to talk to some amazing friends that gave her the best support as well as have a little fun in the process. I do not want to give a false impression of our life. I know friends and family see our Facebook/MySpace pages and think every day is a holiday for us, but they do not see the daily frustrations in the rollercoaster involved with my treatment. Aside from that I refuse to apologize for trying to live a normal life through all of this. Therefore, we put on our best smiles and look positively to the future by making plans and enjoying all there is to life within the confines of my limitations. I will only state this once to make a brief point. I try my hardest to keep my family and friends in the loop but if I do not call or write 24/7 it&#8217;s nothing personal. I am always pushing to keep the bills paid by working full time as well as keep all of my appointments for treatment. For everyone to simply write a few words or make one phone call is way less effort than Amy or I making 20 phone calls or writing 20 emails. That is why these blogs are so incredible. It helps us maintain a balance while keeping our loved ones informed. Okay, I am off my soapbox.</p>
<p>Recently, I have had a few challenges but things seem to be progressing in the right direction. Being in a highly credited institution does not necessarily mean efficiency. The care here at MD Anderson is amazing but I still give Pensacola&#8217;s Sacred Heart a lot of credit for its personal attention. Some hurdles I have experienced is nobody wants to make a decision without your physician so when your physician is on vacation then you suffer. Burkitts Lymphoma does not give you holidays off. I know I could go to see my amazing Oncologist Dr. Sunnenberg and things happen fast when necessary. I would also see him more frequently giving intimate knowledge of my progression and setbacks. That is just not the case here. I felt the same way with Emory Winship Cancer Institute. We are strapped to making this work as they are the Stem Cell transplant pros.</p>
<p>Amy and Liz drove here to be with me Christmas. My parents and Amy&#8217;s dad also made it to be with me. I was so happy to be with my immediate family. I am staying in Conroe TX for the time being and my friends Brent and Leslie have gone beyond what one could hope to make me feel welcome in their home and apart of their family. They made it possible for this Christmas to be the best one yet. We all got wonderful gifts, went to some awesome dinners and just relaxed together at the house. We saw a couple movies, got some laughs in and continued to enjoy every minute as we always do. That is no change of pace either so when we hear the phrase &#8216;Enjoy every minute during this time together&#8217;&#8230;not to sound cocky but we already did because we are madly in love with each other.</p>
<p>Oh!!! The benefit my friends had in Alexandria VA for me was amazing!!! I got to video conference in and see friends I have not seen for years as well as new beautiful people that helped to put the event together. The event raised over $8,000.00 from donated art, t-shirts, woodallions(bling bing chains made of WOOD), stickers, etc. It was a mixed crowd there to support me whether they knew me personally or not. I was in awe and I am so appreciative. This gives Amy and I flexibility financially to pay these new bills, fly Amy back to Pensacola to work occasionally, and to keep available for new expenses that come up throughout my treatment.</p>
<p>I can safely say we have still hit some hurdles, but continue to have such high hopes for the inevitable cure. We have had to fight a little but overall we take the amazing support and move one step forward. Dr. Sunnenberg, Amy, and the love from friends/family is my cure ultimately. Chemicals can only do so much physically while these amazing people have worked their butt off to see me into remission. I am right there. Give me one or two more treatments and transplant here we come!!!</p>
<p>I love you all so much.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Christopher</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris is being discharged today! yea!  We are ready to be home!  We are waiting to speak to the he doctors.  All of his tests came back CLEAR. We got the final ones yesterday so we are super excited about that.  He scored a 95% on his pulminary test yesterday&#8230;which is outstanding after what he has been through!!!!! I swear you guys&#8230;my husband is a BEAST&#8230;he just takes all the stuff they do to him and he keeps going and going.  Never complains&#8230;never will say he is tired.   He is so strong.  I see the strength in him everyday.  And I reassure him that &#8216;it&#8217;s okay to be tired&#8230;or feel like crap&#8217;.  He&#8217;s entitled!!!!  But he never will say it&#8230;not unless I ask!<br />
I have a million questions to ask the docs today&#8230;I am sitting on my bed in a pile of papers &#8230;everything from all his blood work to all of the Stem Cell documents to his appointment schedules.  I am trying to sort it out and comprise all my questions before we go today.<br />
well..that&#8217;s all for now.  Houston will be our home for awhile&#8230;Chris is in the BEST hands!  I have no worries&#8230;and that is saying a lot for me!  I usually question everybody!!!  I&#8217;ll still have my list of concerns&#8230;but most of the time they are on top of things!  I am so grateful he is here.</p>
<p>We want to thank our friends and family for  hinking of us&#8230;.calling, sending messages and e-mails.  It means so much to us!  We love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Wow&#8230;.24 hours can make a huge difference!!!!!  So the Big.lymphoma Guy&#8230;Dr. Fayad advised us to stay here in Houston..  He said it is very crucial that we not miss an opportunity to cure chris and if there is travel involved then&#8230;we could miss that opportunity and it could be fatal.  That&#8217;s all we needed to hear&#8230;we are staying right here in Houston!!!!!  So, our Friends and family are coming to stay here with us at Brent and Leslie&#8217;s and it will be a great christmas&#8230;no matter what!</p>
<p>I feel really good about Chris staying here.  I feel like he is in good hands!  All his tests came back clean!  Yea!  The chemo is working well so far&#8230;we have started the Stem Cell Transplant process&#8230;we are on our way!!!!  I will commute back and forth and be with him as much as possible.  Leslie ( the friend we are staying with) said she would cook for Chris and look after him &#8230;and be my &#8220;stand in&#8221;:) while I am gone.  I trust that he is going to be taken care.  Brent and Leslie and amazing people with big hearts and we feel so blessed to have them in our life.</p>
<p>So&#8230;Chris will be discharged tomorrow.  He will have home health care come in this weekend to give him I.V. fluids.  This flushes the chemo through his kidneys and bladder.  I will leave to go home on Sunday and come back to Houston on the 22nd to be with him.  One day at a time&#8230;that&#8217;s all we can think about.</p>
<p>All in all, Chris is doing well.  He is tired from the chemo&#8230;his fatique level is high&#8230;but that is to be expected.  Other than that&#8230;he has had very little nausia&#8230;his appetite is great and he looks really good.  You would never knowhe&#8217;s been through so much.   I have to say I feel confidant about this process&#8230;I am trusting that all the pieces will come together at the PERFECT time.</p>
<p>Love, Amy</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">The time has flown by&#8230;one day is running into the next and I couldn&#8217;t tell you what the date is.  When your in the hospital&#8230;time is so different.<br />
Today&#8230;Chris has his final test.  His MRI is scheduled for 1:30 pm.  It&#8217;s of the brain.  Then, hopefully we will receive some results of the LP and bone marrow biopsy.  After we get these done and get the results&#8230;we will be able to breathe a sigh of relief!<br />
We are so happy with the chemo results.  The chemo has been &#8216;not as bad&#8217; as the Hyper-Cvad but more consistent.  It&#8217;s interesting.  I can tell that Chris doesn&#8217;t feel as run down&#8230;he is tired for sure but it hasn&#8217;t knocked him completely out.  of coarse we have 3 more days to go&#8230;so we will see what happens.<br />
He did not get sick for the intrathecal methotrexate.  This was the procedure that made him have rigors and vomiting.  But this time he did wonderful!!!<br />
The nurses were amazed this morning when they saw Chris.   The results are astonishing!  We are praying for perfect timing.  We are praying that chemo starts at the perfect time and Stem cell starts at the perfect time.  We don&#8217;t want there to be any time for growth.<br />
I plan to speak with the Stem cell team before we leave.  I want to get the ball rolling and find out what we need to do about swabbing kits for family and getting the proper approvals done.  It&#8217;s a HUGE process.</p>
<p>We plan to stay in Houston after Chris is discharged for a couple days to let him start to feel somewhat normal.  Then we plan to head home on Sunday.  I will have to give Chris shots of nuepogen everyday to raise his WBCs ( white blood counts).  This will help his blood recover so that he can have his chemo right on schedule.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for now. He is doing well.  His spirits are up thanks to all of you!!!!!  keep the guest book signings coming, phone calls and e-mails.  This is the best medicine for Chris&#8230;he loves to feel connected to all of you.  It&#8217;s easy to feel isolated in this place.</p>
<p>Thanks for All your support!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Amy</p>
<p>I want to thank my work&#8230;especially Sheri for rescheduling all my clients for me&#8230;and for my clients being so understanding.  It allows me to be totally &#8216;present&#8217; for Chris and to give him All my attention.  Thank you so much!!!:)</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well&#8230;the chemo started yesterday.  So far so good. A little nausea this morning but no vomiting.  I can see the look in his eye&#8230;that his worn out and sick of being in bed.  The Doc came in this morning and said he is doing good. He had his lumbar puncture today.  It was pretty uncomfortable for him.  He had to breathe through it&#8230;and he broke out in a sweat from head to toe.  His heart rate is a little high because of the stress.  He has had 5 of these lumbar punctures and they are no fun.  They are not painful but uncomfortable and the anticipation is the worst part.  They tried to do one on him on Friday&#8230;with out X-ray and had him hunched over a table in the hospital room poking and prodding around his spine for quite sometime.  Needless to say they were not able to achieve anything and Chris was very stressed out&#8230;his blood pressure was high&#8230;.it really sucks.  If they had read his records they would have seen that the previous LP&#8217;s were preformed with Floroscopy.  This lack of communication is what really urks me&#8230;it&#8217;s unnecessary pain&#8230;discomfort&#8230;not to mention premeds they pumped into his body for No reason at all.  All because they never reviewed his previous LP record.<br />
The one thing that I have learned is to ask AS MANY questions about everything I can.  I am constantly challenging the doctors and nurses to make sure they are on their toes.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m annoying to them&#8230;but I don&#8217;t care.  My WHOLE focus is Chris&#8230;I don&#8217;t care if they have to triple check themselves&#8230;I want it done right!  I repeat myself over and over again.  If we didn&#8217;t mention a lot of his past experience he would have had so many mishaps.  It is really scary.  But the lesson in all of this&#8230;is that only you or someone close to you is your BEST advocate.  Do not rely on the doctors.<br />
I&#8217;m feeling home sick today.  It&#8217;s only Monday&#8230;we have a long way to go. But hopefully this treatment will shrink the tumor and it will all be worth it&#8230;every bit!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Amy</p></div>

We love you guys so much&#8230;Chris is so inspired to get better and PUSH through this.  There literally are No words to express how we/he feels.   We just wanted to say thank you to everyone!  Thank you for getting the word out!  Not only does it support Chris but his story could help so many others who face this challenge!  We are truly blown away by all of it and many times we find ourselves speechless and overwhelmed with gratitude.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to come visit and celebrate his recovery and cure!</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Great news!  We were transferred to the lymphoma floor&#8230;AND Chris is starting chemo right now!!!!  YEA!  His blood work looked great&#8230;his PET scan and CT scan looked clear!  Fingers are crossed!!!!!  The difference is night and day from the floor we were on to this floor.  The people here are so sweet and so helpful and they know EXACTLY what Chris is going through.  The other floor specialized in nuerological type cancer and rehabilitation.  They did not understand how aggressive Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma is.</p>
<p>Our room is great!  VERY spacious and my little bed is comfy&#8230;great view too!  I told Chris we should just try to pretend we are on vacation at the Beau Rivage or something.  So&#8230;we are acting as if we are enjoying some down time and a mini vacation!!!!  You have to fake it till you make it sometimes!</p>
<p>The benefit went great lastnight!!!!  Chris was so excited to see everyone!  It lifted his spirits so much and made him feel super cared about and loved.  He used his webcam&#8230;it was really awesome that he could be apart of it&#8230;so many miles away:)!  Tonight is the second night of the benefit.  Chris will &#8220;webcam in&#8221; tonight as well.</p>
<p>Chris is recieving his premeds right now and is feeling very sleepy.  The benedryl is a kicker&#8230;it knocks him out for about 45 minutes.  And then his first bag of chemo will be hung in just a few minutes!  We are so happy to get started!  Chris and I also found out that he will be able to walk around the WHOLE entire MD Anderson hospital!  This is so awesome because usually he is confined to his room and it feels somewhat like prison.  So it&#8217;s a super big treat to be able to walk around with Chris and go to the aquariam&#8230;listen to the band in the lobby&#8230;look outside.  We are considering the possibility of coming back here for the rest of his chemo.  They seem much more efficient here on the lymphoma floor and the care superceeds pensacola for sure!!!  We were really scared for the first three days&#8230;we thought this place was a nightmare!  But after we talked to the administrator ( thanks to Ndu) and to the oncologist this morning&#8230;things have changed for the better and our confidence is officially restored in MD Anderson!:)</p>
<p>Love,</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well&#8230;.MD Anderson has been interesting!  Can&#8217;t say we are totally impressed.  We had a mishap in the beginning of our visit which spiraled into a domino effect.  Needless to say our first day was extremely disappointing!  There seems to be an EXTREME communication gap here.  It&#8217;s as if the nurses and doctors do not talk to each other nor do they read the notes.  We literally have nurses ask US what the plan is for the day.  Can you imagine being admitted into the hospital and the nurses ask YOU what the plan is for your treatment!!!!!  Wow!<br />
Anyway&#8230;..we are giving them the benefit of the doubt and hoping that things change in a more positive direction.  We met a very nice nurse named &#8216;Ndu&#8217;.  he paged the doctor and one phone call made all the difference.  Ndu said&#8217; communication is one of the biggest parts of nursing and when we as nurses forget this component&#8230;we have failed our patients miserably&#8217;.  He apologized for the anxiety we felt around not knowing what was going on.  He was very nice and so helpful!  Thank you Ndu!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Dr. Fanale expressed concern about Chris not responding totally to previous treatment.  she said there are no clinical trials for Burkitt&#8217;s due to it&#8217;s rare nature.  BUT&#8230;she did say that they have not done a head to head study on R-HYPER/CVAD versus R-MCODOX/IVAC  and there is great success with this later treatment.  Chris has to have a 50% shrinkage in tumor size to qualify for a stem cell transplant.  We will speak to the stem cell team and decide on who to send swabbing kits to for donor possibilities.  If there is a good response to treatment and remission then&#8230;they will most likely do a auto stem cell transplant.</p>
<p>So far Chris has had a chest x-ray, ct scan, pet scan, and bone marrow biopsy on both hips.  he is waiting for his intrathecal methotrexate and lumbar puncture procedure.  He is on-call for an MRI tonight.  He WILL start chemo tomorrow morning!!!  Yea!  We ask that you all pray for a good response!!!  We want to watch this thing melt away before our eyes again.</p>
<p>The benefit for Chris is tonight in V.A.  We are so excited because Chris is going to hopefully webcam into the party so that he can video conference with friends while in the hospital&#8230;I love modern technology!!!</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your support!  we appreciate all of you and your friendship and unconditional love!</p>
<p>We received the results of the CT scan and so far everything is coming back CLEAR of disease!!!  We will keep you all posted on the results as they come in.</p>
<p>Love you guys&#8230;wish we could be there at the benefit!  You have No idea what this means to us.  To all the people who are behind this &#8230;thank you from the bottom of our heart!  You know who you are!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to Chris and his CURE!!!!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris was featured in URB magazine. Go to URB.com and then click on HIVE.  There is a write up about Chris and the benefit that his friends are putting together for him in his home town.  Thank you Beda for getting the word out!!!  WE are so excited about the benefit.  Chris is going to try to video conference in from Houston.</p>
<p>Hope you all are having a great weekend!  We&#8217;re packing and cleaning and getting ready!</p>
<p>Chris&#8217; bag of chemo came out of the pump and spilled all over around 11pm lastnight!  It was a defect in the tube and bag connector.  It really sucked!  Very scary but we got it all worked out.  Chemo freaks me out!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll keep you posted!!!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well the lump is there but not growing thanks to the chemo.  It shrunk a little the first day but then that&#8217;s all.  Chris has appointments ALL week at MD Anderson.  He just got his schedule last night and he has something going on pretty much everyday.  Mostly meetings and testing at this point.  No treatment yet.  We are not sure if he will receive the first rounds of chemo here or if they want to treat him there.  Chris would prefer to be treated at home but we&#8217;ll see.  Dr. Sunnenberg said that this chemo for Chris will be a breeze!  He&#8217;s already had the horrible stuff and this isn&#8217;t anything like that.  That&#8217;s reassuring and good to know.  He said methotrexate is the worst you can get and he has already had three 24 hour bags of that stuff&#8230;YUCK!<br />
Hopefully Chris will breeze through the prep chemo for the transplant.<br />
We are excited to meet Brent and Leslie.  They are the ones who are taking us in to their home for the time that we are in Houston.  They have set up an office for Chris so that he can work.  Their place sounds amazing!<br />
We should get to Houston the evening of Tuesday, December 2nd.<br />
Chris is going to get his chemo this morning. His last bag is today.  We are a little anxious about that.  Not sure if it will start to grow or not.   I would think they would do something about it in Houston if it becomes an issue.</p>
<p>Hope all of you had a wonderful Thanksgiving!!!</p>
<p>Love,<br />

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris and I  were at the doctors office for about 3 hours this morning.  We have realized&#8230;nothing is simple and quick&#8230;.except radiation.  Hopefully that theory will change soon!<br />
Well, he received vincristine and a new drug.  Pretty strong  stuff&#8230;I would tell you the name but I&#8217;m too lazy to get up and search in my file for it. It&#8217;s one of the &#8216;mycin&#8217;s&#8217;  Bleomycin??????  Something like that.  Anyway..It&#8217;s working!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The tumor is shrinking once more.  This thing really plays with our emotions.</p>
<p>He is wearing his  portable pump&#8230;SO COOL!  Sure beats the hospital or even sitting in the infusion center.  The doctors theory is that saturating the cell consistently is better then giving it to you in one shot.  They are still testing this theory but makes sense to me because this way it never gives the cells time to divide.</p>
<p>This whole chemo thing is such a science and although it&#8217;s quite scary&#8230;it&#8217;s very interesting.  I learned that vincristine is derived from several plants.  One is called the &#8216;Happy Tree&#8217;&#8230;well I guess it&#8217;s all in how you look at it!:)  If it works&#8230;we&#8217;re &#8216;happy&#8217;!!!!</p>
<p>We decided to stay home instead of going out to Portofino.  Chris has to have his bag changed every morning and our little dog is going to be in the &#8216;pet resort&#8217; ( so cute) for awhile &#8230;so it doesn&#8217;t make sense to stay out on the beach right now.  Maybe when we get home!  This is my first Thanksgiving since my mom passed away last December from breast cancer&#8230;WOW&#8230;it&#8217;s a crazy time of year for us.  We miss her.  So&#8230;I&#8217;m cooking (yikes).  It will be a beautiful day&#8230;and she will be with us in spirit.   A very interesting thing happened to me&#8230;.I had a lady&#8230;a complete stranger hug me in the middle of Target yesterday.  She said she would love to give me a hug, if I needed one.  Now&#8230;this type of thing obviously doesn&#8217;t happen everyday.  She was the sweetest woman&#8230;very sincere and Something about her reminded me of my mother.  Maybe it was&#8230;in a crazy kind of way.  Nothing surprises me anymore!:)</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for now&#8230;..Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>
<p>We are thankful for:<br />
Our marriage and unconditional love for each other<br />
Our family&#8230;we miss you!<br />
All of our wonderful friends<br />
Chris&#8217; tumor going down<br />
The amazing fund raisers you all have done for Chris<br />
That Chris isn&#8217;t in the hospital<br />
For Chris&#8217; amazing company NSS<br />
For our insurance issues working out<br />
For Robbie<br />
For Jill, Brent and Leslie&#8230;.Thank you for our home away from home&#8230;<br />
For being able to go to MD Anderson.<br />
For all the strangers who have shown us support and love.</p>
<p>We are so blessed! Our gratitude list goes on and on!</p>
<p>We love you!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We found out today that Starting tomorrow morning at 8 am&#8230;.Chris will be hooked up to a 24 hour chemo pump that he will wear on his body for the next 4 days.  The pump looks something like a &#8216;fanny pack&#8217;. The drug he will receive will be a chemo drug called Vincristine. It kills rapidly dividing cells.<br />
This means we will not be in the hospital!!!  Yeah!  Chris will go everyday at 8am to get his bag of chemo changed.<br />
Dr. Romagueara @ MD Anderson recommended we do this to get us through until his first round of salvage chemo. (Which is what he will do prior to the Stem Cell Transplant.)<br />
We will be hopefully spending our Thankgiving out at Portofino Resort.  This was a sweet gift from a client of mine.</p>
<p>We are looking for ward to M.D Anderson&#8230;so that Chris doesn&#8217;t feel like a genie pig anymore.  Enough is enough!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We saw Dr. Sunnenberg today. It&#8217;s confirmed&#8230;the lump is coming back.  He said he is going to contact Chris&#8217; Doctor in Houston to decide which chemo he will be receiving to buy more time before Chris&#8217; appointment on December 3rd @ MD Anderson.  We don&#8217;t know if it will be outpatient or inpatient chemo&#8230;so we may be spending thanksgiving in the hospital.  If Chris has out patient chemo then we will stay at Portofino  Resort&#8230;where we were married and enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner at Terracotta&#8230;a restaurant and place that is dear to our hearts! But we just want to do what is right&#8230;and if that is the hospital&#8230;then that&#8217;s okay with us.</p>
<p>The meeting with Robbie was really awesome!  He is very supportive&#8230;answers every question and brings more hope then I think he realizes.  We talked for over two hours about the process.  Robbie is 40 days post transplant and he says he feel really great!  So promising!!!<br />
We have researched and MD Anderson is the BEST in the country for Stem Cell Transplants.  They do over 700 a year which is remarkable.  They have the very best specialist and doctors that see every kind of cancer. Nothing is &#8216;RARE&#8217; to them.  They have seen it ALL!!!  They have social workers, patient advocates and counselors to help Chris and I on this journey.  We feel very good about our decision to go to MD Anderson. Chris will be receiving the best treatment possible.  Many doctors will review his case&#8230;council with each other and make collective decisions regarding Chris and his recovery and cure.    We feel so blessed to have this opportunity to go to this amazing institution!</p>
<p>The holidays just don&#8217;t matter to me.  The most important thing to me is that Chris and I are together&#8230;and that we take one day at a time.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">So&#8230;Today we meet Robbie.  The other Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma survivor.  He is coming through Pensacola on his way home from MD Anderson and we are going to grab a bite to eat and chat about &#8217;stuff&#8217;.  We are excited to meet him.<br />
The lump is bigger today.  Chris will probably need chemo tomorrow.<br />
We took a long drive together and talked and talked&#8230;we drove out to Perdido beach and brought our dog Oscar.  It was nice to just relax and look out at the beautiful water.<br />
We celebrated our friend Dru&#8217;s 30 birthday last night. I have a feeling this will be the last time we get to really go &#8216;out&#8217; for awhile. But that&#8217;s okay&#8230;because we have 60 plus more years to celebrate with friends!:)<br />
That&#8217;s all today&#8230;we are trying not to let this get us down. FEARLESS, fearless, fearless.<br />
We want to thank you for all the support,gifts and for stopping us in public to introduce yourself.  We have met amazing people along this journey.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">I haven&#8217;t really felt like writing lately because sometimes we just want to feel normal and not have to constantly talk and think about this whole situation.  We are not sure as of Thursday if the lump is growing back.  Chris went to see Dr. Sunnenberg and he said it could be a number of things but we can&#8217;t help to think that maybe it&#8217;s coming back. Chris has an appointment set up for December 3rd in Houston at M.D.Anderson.  He may have to have a little chemo before then to keep things down.  Chris has another appointment with Dr.Sunnenberg on Monday to check things out and see if there are any changes.<br />
We have a wonderful place to stay in Houston which is a relief!  A good friend of mine has a brother that lives there with his girlfriend and they have a guest room for us to use while we are there.  It&#8217;s nice to have a home away from home.  They have been so gracious and sweet to take us in and make us feel welcome in their home.  they live 35 minutes away from M.D.Anderson.</p>
<p>I think Chris and I feel as though the wind was taken out of our sails.  For the first time in a long time we felt like life was getting back to normal then one day we wake up and there the lump is&#8230;right in front of our eyes.  It&#8217;s very heart breaking. Chris says he isn&#8217;t scared or fearful&#8230;just tired of this whole ordeal.  He said today that he feels like he hit his limit.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been writing a lot and staying busy with work.  We will be leaving Tuesday the 2ndof December.  We are not sure what will happen when we get there.  If we will have to stay for 6 weeks or come home then go back for treatment. It&#8217;s all up in the air and overwhelming.</p>
<p>For now we are praying that there is a solution and that the Stem cell transplant will offer the cure.</p>
<p>Love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Our weekend was wonderful! We had a really relaxing time in Destin ,Florida.  We went to dinner at PF Changs and stayed at a friends condo for a night.<br />
Chris has severe burns on his neck from the radiation. It looks like sun poisoning. This is normal considering the intense regime Chris had over the last 3 weeks.  The AWESOME news is that Dr. Sunnenberg says Chris looks astoundingly good!  For a man that has had 7 rounds of chemo,chicken pox, and 30 rounds of radiation&#8230;.he looks pretty incredible!!!!  The radiation will continue to work for up to two weeks post treatment.<br />
We hopefully figured out our insurance situation but will know more in the next couple of days about the transplant coverage.  Our new policy starts on Dec 1 st.  Dr. Sunnenberg wants to send Chris to M.D Anderson around that time for some testing to see if he is in remission and to speak to a lymphoma specialist.<br />
We feel that he is in remission.  We just need the proof.  These next three weeks we will focus on building Chris&#8217; endurance and getting him as physically fit as possible&#8230;so if he has to have the transplant&#8230;his body will be ready.  We started walking last night&#8230;about three miles.  His diet will be a big component in this whole process. Lot&#8217;s of fresh salads&#8230;protein, fruits, and veggies.<br />
We are almost there!!!  Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers through this next month.We are hoping these test come back&#8230;COMPLETE REMISSION!!!</p>
<p>I want to thank our family as well as&#8230;.Abby,Jill,  and Stephanie for everything!!!</p>
<p>We Love you guys so much!!! Thank you to our friends for supporting us through this crazy time in our lives!</p>

<p>Wish I had more to talk about. We are hoping for good news tomorrow.  We have a back up plan&#8230;we&#8217;ll see how things go.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Today was a very heavy day&#8230;.it&#8217;s hard to keep your chin up when you are faced with so much uncertainty. I have to be honest&#8230; Today was a struggle for me.  We spent a large part of our anniversary fighting with the insurance company.  It&#8217;s hard sometimes to see past everything.  I have glimpses of how life used to be&#8230;not a real care in the world&#8230;no stress to really speak about.  Chris and I have always celebrated our love everyday. We&#8217;ve always tried to see who could make the other one the happiest.  So, really our anniversary is just an extension of what we do on a daily basis. I never take his love for granted&#8230;I never have&#8230;I enjoy him so much and he blows me away everyday with his kindness and his sincere heart.  I have always said and feel very strongly that every woman should feel the way Chris makes me feel.  I used to be afraid to speak about this kind of thing because I never wanted to seem like I was boasting&#8230;.But I&#8217;m very proud of the love that we share and I think it is important to express this&#8230;especially today.<br />
We went to his last radiation today&#8230;then we celebrated with a cup of coffee at Starbucks!:)  Chris had his appointment with our yoga friend Linda.  He went for a jog and he said when he got home after his run&#8230;he could tell the color in his skin came back more than ever. We are going to go ahead a meet with the docotors at M.D Anderson.  We are not going to deny ourselves an opportunity to speak with some of the best in the country.  That might happen within the next week.  We will see what they have to say and just perceiver.  What ever it takes.  I said it before and I will say it a million times&#8230;I/we will not stop until we reach remission and CURE!  That is my mission and nothing will stand in my way!</p>
<p>I want to take a minute to thank a couple of people&#8230;First,we received the sweetest anonymous gift .  It was a framed art piece of a couple with strings tied to their hearts and it had the most beautiful poem about love on it.  Thank you&#8230;it was perfect and we will treasure it always.<br />
Thank you to Caroline&#8230;for the Godiva chocolates.  You are so loving and giving and Chris and I appreciate you so much!  Cheryl&#8230;thank you for your help with the insurance info!  You are really a huge support to Chris and I.  Thank you to our friends and to our family&#8230;I hope you know how much you mean to us.  Thank you for putting Chris on all the prayer lists and thinking of him everyday.  We feel the support from all of you&#8230;and we are overwhelmed with gratitude.</p>
<p>Well, now we are going to just sit together and enjoy the rest of today.</p>
<p>I will keep you posted!</p>
<p>We love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Today was a roller coaster!  Dr. Sunnenberg said that Chris looked great&#8230;his blood counts were fantastic.  Everything looked really good.  He said he was going to solidify things with M.D Anderson and talk to the lymphoma guru&#8230;Dr. Romaguera.   yesterday&#8230;.Out of sheer curiosity&#8230;Chris called our insurance company to check on our coverage regarding the Stem cell Transplant.  To our surprise&#8230;we have a hidden exclusion in our policy that does NOT cover Stem cell Transplants.  Talk about PANIC!  A stem cell transplant can cost $400,00 plus.  M.D Anderson works directly with the insurance company and will refuse treatment when they find out about this exclusion.  So, as an extra precaution we were prepared to cancel our COBRA policy and go on to another policy with the same insurance company that offered better coverage even for pre-existing conditions.  Chris had everything ready to go&#8230;faxed it all over to the company for approval&#8230;AND  then another bomb got dropped on us&#8230;.WE can not sign on with an independent plan until we EXHAUST all 18 months of our COBRA insurance.  We have 13 more months to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>PANIC! And more PANIC!  Chris even asked the representative this question&#8230;&#8217;So&#8230;you mean to tell me that if this was the only treatment that could save my life&#8230;you would still deny me the Stem Cell Transplant???&#8217;.  The representatives reply was&#8230;&#8217;Yes Sir!&#8217;<br />
How about that!  This is how unbelievably warped the insurance system is.  Hidden exclusions in insurance policy&#8217;s that literally rob people of the opportunity of a CURE!  It makes me sick to my stomach!<br />
We are overwhelmed with every emotion you can imagine!  The only thing I can say is&#8230;I pray to God that Chris is in remission.<br />
We are working on a back up plan.  And we won&#8217;t stop until we get Chris what he needs for his cure!</p>
<p>I ask that all of you keep him in your thoughts and prayers over the next few days!  His last radiation is tomorrow.  Our fingers are crossed and we are hoping for the very best outcome!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is our 3 year wedding anniversary.  The perfect day for a miracle!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We got a phone call from Dr Sunnenberg&#8217;s nurse today and he wants to send Chris to M.D Anderson for the Stem cell Transplant.  We have our big meeting with him tomorrow.  We will go over the &#8216;plan&#8217;.  Most likely we will go to Houston and Chris will receive a series of tests.  All the testing will take about a week.  We will move forward based the results of his tests.  As far as we know&#8230;Chris COULD already be in remission. His last PET Scan was BEFORE his 30 radiation treatments.  So, there is a very good chance that the rest of the tumor that you see in he scan is GONE!!  That might change things a little.  We are not sure that MD Anderson will go forward with a stem cell transplant if Chris is in remission.   That is a question we will ask Dr. Sunnenberg tomorrow.  If they decide not to do it&#8230;we may see if Chris can harvest his stem cells NOW and have them frozen at MD Anderson&#8230;Just in case he needs them later.  That is another question we will ask.<br />
Let me just say&#8230;we have learned so much about insurance and what to ask for in the future.  F.Y.I&#8230;Here are some things to ask and look for in your policy:</p>
<p>1) Cancer coverage<br />
2)Exclusions in your policy&#8230;such as Stem cell transplant<br />
3)Disability policy<br />
4) in patient and out patient coverage amount</p>
<p>We learned the HARD way&#8230;make sure you have this coverage in your policy.  Chris was healthy, 28 years old,worked out regularly,ate healthy.  You just never know.  It&#8217;s better to be safe then sorry.</p>
<p>We will know more tomorrow and I will keep you guys posted.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your sweet comments and support. We honestly couldn&#8217;t get through this without all of you.  Every comment you leave&#8230;inspires us to stay strong and to keep going! We are praying for remission.  That&#8217;s all we are focused on. We are embracing health!!!:)</p>
<p>Goodnight!  Love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well&#8230;so far so good!:)  We saw the radiation doctor( not sure what his proper title is) yesterday.  He felt around on Chris&#8217; neck and said that it looked GREAT!  He said he looks( and feels) tumors all day long and Chris&#8217; neck doesn&#8217;t feel like there is a mass at all!  No tumor!  Now, there may be residual cells left behind that could certainly turn into a tumor and this is why we are proceeding with a Stem cell Transplant. Chris has come so far and been through so much that we can&#8217;t stop now.  We are almost there!!!<br />
Hearing the doctor say&#8217;it looks good&#8230;I don&#8217;t feel a tumor&#8217;&#8230;is like music to our ears!  We still need a CT scan to prove that everything is gone&#8230;and that will definitely  be a big day for us!!!  Chris has been dealing with this spot on his neck since last December!  We can&#8217;t wait to hear those words&#8217; YOU ARE IN REMISSION&#8217;!!!!<br />
He has 6 more radiation treatments left and we pray that it melts the last of the bad cells away!  Dr. Sunnenberg said that there was a case of Burkitts that did chemo and radiation therapy ( like Chris) and he went in to remission just from that!<br />
This has been such a crazy year for us&#8230;we have had a lot of good days and a lot of bad days&#8230;but we are getting through it!<br />
I&#8217;ll keep you posted!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We heard from Robbie (The other Burkitt&#8217;s survivor)&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe we found him!!!!  Dr.Sunnenberg said we needed to find another &#8216;Chris Blok&#8217; somewhere in the world&#8230;and we found him!!!!!<br />
He is receiving treatment at MD Anderson and gave us the names of his doctors. Dr. Sunnenberg is affiliated with mD Anderson and has access to all his information.<br />
Another crazy thing is that&#8230;. He had the same doctor that Chris had at Emory&#8230;Dr. Flowers.   I can&#8217;t tell you how relieved we are to have found someone with localized stage one Burkitt&#8217;s in the neck area.  Robbie&#8217;s did not spread either&#8230;like typical Burkitt&#8217;s. The similarities are endless!<br />
He is so helpful and has offered to speak with Chris and I about anything treatment related at anytime.  I am so grateful    We are going to take his info into Dr. Sunnenberg tomorrow. I can&#8217;t wait to see what he says!!!!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We had such a great weekend with friends!  It was beautiful weather and so relaxing!  Chris and I needed to reconnect with friends and have this amazing down time.  Over the weekend ( Sunday) I started to do my obsessive researching again&#8230;which I have not allowed myself to do for quite sometime because it tends to create a lot of stress for me.  I read so many abstracts, and medical reports&#8230;all the good the bad and the ugly.  It can be very overwhelming.  But I was so driven to research this time.  I always feel like, just maybe, I will stumble across one little piece of info that could change everything.  I read alot about spontaneous remission, which is a real medical term, that is used when people go into remission from all kinds of random things.  There are hundreds,and hundreds possibly even thousands of reports about cases of spontaneous remission and about 32% of them are lymphoma. Interesting!  I found several on Burkitts lymphoma.  A spontaneous remission happened to a girl with Burkitts who got the measles. Then, after that her tumor disappeared.  I was so blown away by this amazing phenomenon.<br />
Well today I felt the same urge to get back on the internet.  And I ran across a story that gave me chills from head to toe. It&#8217;s about a guy, who lives in Atlanta who is about Chris&#8217; age&#8230;that had Burkitt&#8217;s,localized stage one, in his neck.  He just finished his Stem Cell  transplant and he has a blog (just like Chris)  that talks about his journey.It was so parallel to his situation that it blew us away. I have chills just thinking about it because the story is as if Chris was writing about his own experience.   There is something incredible that happens when you find another human being has a story like yours.  Chris e-mailed him right away.   I hope he responds. I will keep you guys posted.</p>
<p>Chris is doing great.  he said he feels like the area on his neck gets firm and soft. It changes from time to time and has done this from the beginning. i am not sure what this means.<br />
He had his radiation appointment this morning and is going for another this afternoon. he also has a yogic breathing session with Linda.  It&#8217;s about an hour of  guided deep, cleansing breath.  Perfect for someone going through all that he is going through.<br />
He will have his blood drawn tomorrow to check his levels. Last time they looked pretty good.  Red counts were still a little low.  Dr. Sunnenberg says he has &#8216;elastic&#8217; bone marrow!  I guess that&#8217;s a good thing! We&#8217;ll take it!<br />
I&#8217;m a little scared about the whole process that lies ahead of us.  I am praying that it goes perfect and Chris  will do SO well!  I ask that you all keep him in your thoughts and prayers over the next week.( and i know you are) We are hoping that the radiation will really shrink things down to nothing.<br />
This has been the craziest journey.  It&#8217;s challenges you on every level.   He is the bravest man I know.  He faces everything, every piece of uncertainty with courage and strength.  He refuses to identify with anything going on. Chris just has this attitude of&#8217; let&#8217;s get on with it&#8230;. so that I can get on with my incredible life&#8217;.  There is no bitterness&#8230;or why me.  I am just in awe of him.  He inspires me everyday to live a life of more purpose, and strength.</p>
<p>We love you guys!<br />
Thank you for your hugs and support.  We appreciate all the love we receive from everyone.  There are no words to express our gratitude.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We met with Dr.Sunnenberg yesterday.  It was a good visit overall but there are still some unanswered questions.  He was VERY happy with how Chris&#8217; neck looked and told us that the oncologist that he conferenced with didn&#8217;t think radiation would keep the tumor down.  It was a shot in the dark&#8230;. But surprise surprise&#8230;It&#8217;s working! We are thrilled!  We are still waiting to find out if we are going to Emory for a Stem Cell Transplant or if we are going to NCI.  I&#8217;m not really clear on ALL the details but I guess it matters which type of Stem Cell Chris needs and how involved it will be.  It would be nice to do the preparatory chemotherapy here at home&#8230;then drive 4 1/2 hours to Atlanta for Stem Cell collection then the transplant. Then there is a possibility that they will let Chris recover back at home at Sacred Heart.  I&#8217;m not sure how all that will work and it was all kind of mentioned lightly in our meeting with Dr. Sunnenberg.  Frankly, it scares me a little to  have Chris leave Atlanta&#8230;if anything were to go wrong&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t want Chris to get an infection in transition.  I&#8217;m just trusting that everything will workout EXACTLY the way it supposed&#8230;.The transplant is going to be perfect!<br />
We are thinking that we are going with an AUTO transplant,which is much safer. They will extract Chris&#8217; stem cells from him and then give them back.  Dr.Sunnenberg wanted to speak with Dr. Dunleavy at NCI before making that call for sure.  there are many risk factors with an Allo stem cell( someone else&#8217;s&#8230;possibly his sister&#8217;s&#8230;if she&#8217;s a perfect match) but there are a lot of benefits too.  there is a 1 in 5 chance that his sister will be compatible.<br />
Chris feels really good!  We have enjoyed this down time so much. Life has felt somewhat normal the last two weeks.  It&#8217;s been so refreshing and will give us the strength we need to get through the transplant.  His last radiation treatment is on our 3 year wedding anniversary&#8230;November 5th. How fitting!!!<br />
Today is my dad&#8217;s birthday.  And he and I did the breast cancer 5K in honor of my mother who passed away from breast cancer last December.  It was very emotional for my dad and I &#8230;but it was so sweet and incredibly moving!  There were, what seemed to be thousands of people there!  And SO many survivors!  I believe that when we find the cure for one cancer it will unlock the door for other cures!  I can&#8217;t wait for us to totally annihilate this disease.<br />
So for now Chris is still doing radiation twice a day&#8230;then seeing the doctor next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Just real quick&#8230;.I got to meet the guys in radiation.  They are hilarious!!!  One of them was showing me the way the radiation machine works and how it targets the area on Chris&#8217; neck and I made the comment that the machine was soooo precise!  The tech (who has a very thick New York accent) replied&#8230;. &#8216; well, this isn&#8217;t pin the tail on the donkey,my friend&#8217;!  I laughed so hard  I think I almost wet my pants!  Chris and I have laughed and laughed about that!</p>
<p>Well, I will leave you with that story!:)</p>
<p>Hope all of you are having a beautiful weekend and thank you so much for everything!</p>
<p>We love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris had his treatments today.  He is getting twice the amount that the average person going through this would get and he still thinks it&#8217;s a piece of cake. Aside from some lite fatigue&#8230;he has really done well with the whole thing. The techs explained to Chris that the beam is at it&#8217;s strongest point when it hits the tumor.  This is why it doesn&#8217;t completely fry his skin.  It can still cause dryness and some irritation&#8230;but so far so good.  We went to the gym again today and we are just ENJOYING every healthy minute!!!! Chris amazes me with his energy!<br />
We called Dr. Sunnenbergs office to see if there is anything we need to do to get the ball rolling for his Stem Cell transplant.  (Paper work,testing etc)  We don&#8217;t want there to be any lag time.<br />
Basically&#8230;after radiation,he may be tested once more then he will do preparatory chemo here OR perhaps at NCI for 2 rounds then the third round will be the mega dose that will kill his stem cells&#8230;.. then they will give them back, creating new clean blood for Chris.  The whole process should take 4-6 weeks. We have a friend who did it in 16 days.  The main concern is infection.  He will have no defense,so it&#8217;s crucial to protect him from potential threats for infection.<br />
Chris and I have set up a conference with a man named Gordon who has gone through all of this before after a relapse of mantel cell lymphoma.  He is doing well and knows first hand how things will go for us.<br />
We have met some pretty incredible people along the way.  Thanks to Cheryl (and Kyler),Danny, Gordon, Jolly and Sara&#8230;not to mention all of the great people on the lymphoma forum&#8230;Chris and I have had all of our questions answered quickly.  Everyone is so helpful and compassionate.  It&#8217;s been amazing.</p>
<p>Today was a good day!:)</p>
<p>We want to send prayers to the Sparkman family who lost their precious little boy to lymphoblastic lymphoma last night.  Michael was such an inspiration to us and so courageous!!!  We are sending you hugs and hoping you are able to find some peace in all this grief.</p>
<p>We love you guys!<br />
Thank you for you sweet cards and comments&#8230;.you have no idea what it does for our/his spirit!</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Not much to talk about really&#8230;which is a good thing!  We had a great day.  Chris went for his RADS today and was telling me about some of the funny conversations that he has with the techs.  It&#8217;s pretty entertaining to say the least.  He said they seem like really nice guys&#8230;the whole process is really quite pleasant.  Chris and I had a nice lunch outside and then went for a long walk at sunset today.  The weather is just perfect, so we are trying to enjoy the natural air as much as possible.  Days like today are priceless.<br />
He will go for blood work and to see the doc on Friday.  He&#8217;s going to have a session with my friend Linda the yoga instructor on Thursday.  So far things are going well and his neck looks pretty good.  It&#8217;s hard to tell sometimes if things are shrinking because of the scar tissue.  I am constantly looking at it for any changes and so far it looks great!!! I am hoping that the radiation will mop up all the last bit of this tiny little tumor.  And then if we do a Stem cell transplant as an insurance policy then that&#8217;s fine with us.<br />
We ask that everyone imagine that tiny black dot on his PET scan ( pictured in the photo gallery) GONE.  If we all are focused on it disappearing and praying for remission&#8230;I have no doubt that it will happen!<br />
The radiation is pretty powerful stuff!  My friend had a large tumor in her stomach&#8230;MALT lymphoma and the radiation alone put her in remission.  Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma is much more aggressive&#8230;but Chris has had 7 chemos&#8230;on top of 30 radiation treatments&#8230;.I&#8217;m thinking it might not have a prayer!</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s all I have tonight!  Although, I do want to say one more thing&#8230;we are sending our love and prayers to Michael Sparkman and his family tonight&#8230;he is a 7 year old that is struggling for his life and has a very aggressive lymphoma.  You can find his profile on the caring bridge site under Michael Sparkman.  We are praying that the family find peace in this most difficult time.</p>
<p>Love you guys and thank you for your wonderful comments and support&#8230;We are so grateful for all of you!</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well, we had our appointment today with Dr. Sunnenberg.    We were able to see the PET/CT Scans and there was a huge difference in the size of the tumor. It&#8217;s MUCH smaller! It looks like its about a forth of what it was to begin with.  Chris started his radiation and so far so good.  It hasn&#8217;t shrunk the tumor but it&#8217;s definitely keeping it down.  Now, some people say that it will fry the hell out of it and others think it will just keep it at bay. So, it&#8217;s hard to say exactly what is going to happen.  Chris is most likely going to have a Stem Cell Transplant.  We are waiting to hear back from NCI.  Dr.Sunnenberg is going to see Chris every Monday and Friday to take his blood samples and check the area on his neck.  He will keep a close eye on him for the next two weeks.<br />
We are staying super hopeful!  There is still a lot on the table.  The weeks to come will map out our plan of action.</p>
<p>We ask that our friends and family pray that Chris is able to achieve remission very soon!<br />
He feels great!  And he looks wonderful.  All side effects have subsided. Chris went to the gym today&#8230;he feels really good.  The radiation is a piece of cake compared to chemo.   That really kicked his butt!!!</p>
<p>We love you and we will keep you posted!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Today was a good day.  Chris had a PET scan at 7:30 this morning and had to wear his mask for 20 minutes during the scan. That part wasn&#8217;t fun but it went well overall.  He also had his two radiation treatments&#8230;one at 8:oo and one at 2:30.  I noticed the area on his neck looks a little inflamed.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s inflammation or if it&#8217;s growing.  I&#8217;m trying to just stay neutral until we meet with Dr.Sunnenberg on Monday. Something tells me we will have to have another chemo treatment soon but we will see.  It could just be the radiation causing  the inflammation.<br />
We are looking forward to the weekend.  His counts are excellent which means we can go to the movies or dinner or whatever we want to do.  It &#8217;s such a great feeling to have freedom to live your life.<br />
I went to meet with my friend today who is an advanced yoga instructor/life coach/energy healer&#8230;shes just AWESOME!  She has helped me so much !  There is an abundance of fear when you or someone you love deeply is faced with cancer.  It&#8217;s easy to get swept up in the fear and neglect yourself.  It felt good to relax and recharge so that I can be fully &#8216;present&#8217; for Chris.  My friend is going to work with Chris as well.  I think we both will benefit from this time with her.  She teaches a lot of breathing techniques and Tai yoga massage&#8230;stretching, etc.<br />
We are looking forward to our meeting on Monday.  This should be very informative.  I will keep you all posted!</p>
<p>I want to take a minute to say thank you to all of the people who have reached out to Chris and myself.  We are so blown away by the generosity of complete strangers, who have read Chris story.  We are thankful for our friends and family for supporting us in ways that are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Thank you , Thank you&#8230;from the bottom of our hearts!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Nothing confuses me more than &#8216;radiation therapy&#8217; and the whole concept of burning cancer from the inside out. Just so weird and I can&#8217;t really wrap my brain around it.<br />
I&#8217;m going to be really honest&#8230;things are very confusing right now&#8230;I feel like I do not have one ounce of a grip on what exactly is going on. Which quite frankly is terrifying&#8230;because I&#8217;ve always had a pretty good idea of what is going on and where we are headed.<br />
This is what I do know though&#8230;.<br />
We have a meeting scheduled with Dr. Sunnenberg Monday morning to discuss our plan. Chris has a PET scan scheduled tomorrow morning at 7:30 am&#8230;geeesh!  He had two radiation treatments today and it feels a little tender in the area they treated.  These are the options:</p>
<p>1)Radiation for 3 weeks then chemo<br />
2)Radiation and chemo at the same time<br />
3) radiation then stem cell transplant<br />
4) Radiation and chemo then Stem cell transplant</p>
<p>So&#8230;these are our options.  The stem cell transplant will involve Chris and I moving up to NCI for 4-6 weeks.  Chris will have to take a leave of absence most likely because I don&#8217;t think he will be able to work.  He works from home&#8230;so it&#8217;s possible he will feel okay some of the time to work a little.   We won&#8217;t know until we get there and see how he feels.<br />
It&#8217;s just too stressful to think about honestly.  It&#8217;s in Gods hands.  I just want Chris back to his new self&#8230;and full of energy!  Whatever it takes to get us there&#8230;is what we will have to do!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted!</p>
<p>love, Amy</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris woke me up this morning and said&#8230;we have an appointment for radiation at 9:30 am.  Dr. Sunnenberg doesn&#8217;t waste anytime.  When he says GO&#8230;you just GO!  So out of bed and back to the hospital we went for consult with the radiation doctor to talk about our goals.  This was an interesting conversation that went something like this&#8230;.we are giving you radiation TODAY.  I&#8217;ve only done this once before on a guy your age&#8230;15 years ago with Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma. Who is alive and well today.  This will buy us sometime before you go for your Stem Cell Transplant!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay&#8230;I know we have talked about possibilities of Stem Cell&#8230;. but we never said &#8216;for sure&#8217; this is what we are doing.  So the roller coaster continues.<br />
I just sat there in shock&#8230;.and asked if this is what Dr.Sunnenberg said???  He informed Chris and I that he had a big conference with several doctors around the world&#8230;FLowers, Sunnenberg, Dunleavy , and their colleges and they are ALL in agreement&#8230;Stem Cell is the way to go.  I asked him IF Chris goes into remission from radiation and chemo would we still consider Stem Cell at that point?  His answer was YES!  Okay&#8230;whatever it takes.  At this point we surrender to the process and we will do whatever it takes to CURE Chris of this awful disease.<br />
So after our consult Chris went back for his treatment.  They fit him for his face mask&#8230;which is pretty crazy stuff by the way and looks a bit like &#8216;Hell Raiser&#8217;( that guy with the needles in his face.)  It&#8217;s a creepy mask.  The mask snaps down onto the table while Chris&#8217; face is in it and they use beams to burn out the lymph node and cancer.  It is basically an internal sunburn.  It&#8217;s a 10 minute process&#8230;thank god.<br />
You know&#8230;everyday brings something new&#8230;you just have to roll with it.</p>
<p>Chris and I had an incredible conversation yesterday about the things we want to accomplish in life&#8230;</p>
<p>Going through this process,whether you are the patient or the caregiver&#8230;one thing remains the same-and that is the desire to live life to the fullest.  We want to do it ALL when Chris goes into remission and is cured.  It&#8217;s almost as if someone turned up the volume on life and it speaks louder to us than ever before!  Everything we have ever talked about from going to Europe to having a child is right in the forefront of our minds and hearts.  There is NO time to waste! The quote&#8217; life is what happens when you are making plans&#8217;&#8230; has more meaning than ever.  Life did happened when we were making plans&#8230;and unfortunately they stayed just that&#8230;.PLANS.<br />
Those days are over for Chris and I&#8230;the days of planning and not doing&#8230; are in the past.  We are on a mission to experience ALL  the wonderful things that life has to offer.</p>
<p>There is a powerful feeling that comes over me when I grab Chris&#8217; hand and he grabs mine as we walk into each doctors appointment,hospital visit , challenge. It&#8217;s a brave fearlessness that happens the minute we grab hands and with our chin up&#8230;we walk right into the unknown.  We have always known but now we have proven that anything is possible with love&#8230;.anything!</p>
<p>So..who knows what tomorrow will bring but we will keep you posted.  Chris will get radiation twice a day, 5 days a week for 3 weeks.  Then we have no idea what is going to happen&#8230;Chemo? or Stem cell? or Both?  We shall see!</p>
<p>Love you guys!  Thank you for EVERYTHING!!!!  We could never express our gratitude in this life time!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">I&#8217;m so tired&#8230;. I can barely hold my eyes open. The last five days have been so intense.<br />
Chris finally broke his fever&#8230;.his chicken pox are healing nicely and his blood counts are finally going up not down.  Dr. Sunnenberg came by to check on Chris this morning and was pleased with how he was progressing. Dr. E (can&#8217;t pronounce his name) the infectious disease Doctor came by and said he was free to go home! Yea!  Then we got a phone call from Dr. Sunnenberg after he left the hospital letting us know that he was able to speak to our oncologist at Emory University&#8230;Dr Flowers and he said based on the power point presentation of pictures that Chris put together&#8230;.Dr. Flowers and his colleges in the lymphoma department at the Windship Cancer Institute were VERY PLEASED!  He said Chris was doing very well with treatment and thought we should start radiation&#8230;. then do the last four rounds of chemo after radiation.  There is NO way to do both at the same time because as you can see&#8230;the chemo treatments are VERY hard on Chris&#8217; body.  So we would take a break, radiate and then finish the last four treatments.</p>
<p>Chris had his Cat scan today of his neck, chest, abdomen and groin area.  The test came back PERFECT&#8230;.still stage one, localized in the neck area.  It has not traveled and the chemo is working!  Today was a good day!  Good news all the way around.  We are still not ruling out a Stem cell Transplant.  We have a lot to think about. My wish is that we get our remission with treatment locally. That&#8217;s my wish.  BUT we are willing to do whatever our doctors recommend because, so far they have been amazing and they have saved my husbands life by giving his the correct diagnoses and proper treatment&#8230;So,what they say GOES at this point.</p>
<p>Chris and I want to thank everyone for their comments!  You really have no idea just how much we look forward to reading them out loud to each other.  It brightens everyday and gives us both the strength we need to press through the day.  We also want to say thank you for your donations on our cureforchris.com website.  We are truly blown away by your support and your kindness.</p>
<p>We love you guys so much!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris STILL has a low grade fever. It stays between 99.1 and 99.6.  Dr. Sunnenberg came in today&#8230;.he LOVED the way Chris&#8217; neck looked!!! YEA!  But he was not happy with the fact that he had chicken pox, fischers, and no blood counts. So, needless to say&#8230;we will be hanging out in the hospital for awhile&#8230;at least until Chris has some defense.  He got more platelet&#8217;s last night and it brought them up quite a bit!  His transfusion was pointless!  The 2 bags of blood did absolutely nothing!  BUMMER!</p>
<p>Good news is&#8230;Chris looks good&#8230;.he&#8217;s eating great!  He&#8217;s sleeping and his spirits are high!!!!  We laugh and watch TV&#8230;talk and joke around trying to entertain ourselves.  It&#8217;s not so bad!  I mean of coarse we would rather be doing other things that are MUCH more fun&#8230;BUT it could be worse and we feel really blessed!<br />
He is still in contact isolation and can not leave his room. Everyone has to &#8217;suit up&#8217; and wear a mask&#8230;etc.  Except me:)!   He&#8217;s used to my kooties! LOL!  Just Kidding!  Although I do wear a mask from time to time&#8230;just in case!</p>
<p>Chris is still getting round the clock antibiotics and I think they are helping because his mouth soars are healing and so are his chicken pox on his face.  YEA!</p>
<p>Overall&#8230;he is doing fine!  Hopefully today will be uneventful and he can go home soon!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris was in good spirits today&#8230;when I opened my eyes this morning he said&#8230;&#8217;Good Morning beautiful&#8217;&#8230;and I melted. He has the most sincere and loving spirit I have ever encountered.  I love this man will all that I have!  I can&#8217;t imagine not being by his side through this.  I do not feel that the lymphoma is a blessing ( and let me stress that) BUT however&#8230;I do feel blessed to have found a love so deep within myself for another human being.  Nothing can take that away from me&#8230;and that is the biggest gift in all of this.</p>
<p>Chris had &#8216;Rigors&#8217; last night. For those of you who don&#8217;t know what these are&#8230;They are intense shakes almost convulsions.  It&#8217;s scary because they are obviously involuntary and uncontrollable.  I buzzed the nurse to come right away. In the mean time I told Chris to focus on his breath&#8230;.slow inhalations and slow exhalations and we were breathing together&#8230;.I bundled him in blankets and we continued breathing and i kept telling him that &#8216; he was okay&#8217; and for him to keep telling himself&#8230;&#8217;I'm Okay&#8217;.  After he got warm and we did our breathing&#8230;30 minutes had gone by and FINALLY the nurse came in and said she never got our message.  SCARY HUH?<br />
What I have realized through all of this&#8230;is that fear and panic can take you down a scary road.  The minute you focus on your breath, close you eyes and go within and tell yourself mentally&#8230;that you are okay and truly believe that you ARE&#8230;.Things can turn around in an instant and you have won half the battle!!!<br />
Chris and I have used this tool countless times through this experience.  It&#8217;s such a powerful thing to have&#8230;and the amazing thing is that everybody has it&#8230;they just don&#8217;t realize it,and the fear takes over.</p>
<p>Needless to say,Chris was able to sleep and did not require medication to calm his Rigors.</p>
<p>His counts are continuing to drop but we refuse to let this scare us or take over our thoughts.  There is a solution and a RIGHT answer to bring his counts up and for Chris to continue on his chemo schedule.</p>
<p>His heart rate is 120.It&#8217;s high but his body is under so much stress and is fighting hard to come back up.</p>
<p>The infectious disease Doctor came in this morning to check out Chris and see if this rash was in fact shingles or something else.  WEll&#8230;.it&#8217;s just chicken pox!!!!!  Can you believe it&#8230;at 28years old&#8230;.my husband has chicken pox.  We just laughed about it&#8230;I mean what else can you do, right?<br />
Here&#8217;s the blessing&#8230;Chicken pox can be deadly in adults &#8230;especially cancer patients and can lead to pneumonia.  The blessing is that all along Chris had been receiving the perfect antibiotic through his chemo regimen, that never allowed it to progress into FULL blown adult chicken pox!!! PHEEEEW! Thank you God!!!</p>
<p>We ask that you keep Chris in your thoughts and prayers&#8230;so that his counts come up and we can proceed with treatment.  Time is of the essence in his case.  Every day counts!!!</p>
<p>We want to thank our family for pulling together for us and supporting us in ways we never imagined!  Thank you to all our friends and people we don&#8217;t know personally&#8230;who have left us the most amazing and thoughtful messages.  We are truly awestruck by the love we feel from everyone.</p>
<p>We love you!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">UGH!  What a hectic night and day.  Last night, Chris and I had my dad over for dinner and Chris got to eat his steak.  After dad left Chris took a nice relaxing bath then we laid in bed to watch a movie.  I reached over to kiss Chris and I noticed his lips were on FIRE!!!  I asked him if he was okay&#8230;and he said &#8216;yes&#8230;why&#8217;?  I told him he was on fire and we needed to check his temperature.  So&#8230;we did and it was 101.6!!!!!!!!  YIKES!<br />
So I gave him some Tylenol and ice under his arms and behind his neck and we called the doctor.  The doctor said to give it an hour.  We checked it every hour and it did continue to go down slightly.  By midnight his temp was 99.1 and stayed that way ALL night and morning.<br />
99.1 is still a low grade fever though and is still something to be concerned about, so I asked Chris to call the doc and get her feedback on what to do.  She instructed him to go to the ER&#8230;.THE &#8216;ER&#8217;!!!!  Mind you&#8230;he has no White blood cells, no red blood cells and no platelets.  The ER is the LAST place he needs to go.  But Chris wore his mask and showed up at the ER around 9:30am.  They checked his blood levels to find that instead of going up&#8230;they were plummeting.  His fever was 98.5 but they decided to keep him because of his levels.<br />
So we are now back on the 2nd floor in our room for an indefinite amount of time.He&#8217;s getting another blood transfusion, antibiotics and fluids.  Who knows when we will be out of here.  We were so looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend before he had to come back to receive his next dose of chemo&#8230;OH WELL!  I&#8217;m just glad that he is being taken care of and soon he will feel better.<br />
The infectious disease people are coming to see him tomorrow to figure out his shingles situation.  I don&#8217;t think he is contagious but we want to make absolutely sure what we are dealing with.  His blood and cultures came back fine, so who knows what is going on and why he&#8217;s running this fever.<br />
They gave him two percacett for the pain he&#8217;s been having with something called &#8216;fischers&#8217; and I will  spare you all the details.  My poor baby has had everything from shingles to rashes to nose bleeds and everything in between.  After he took the percacetts he looked at me and said&#8230;&#8217; I feel amazing&#8217;!  I haven&#8217;t heard Chris say this in months!</p>
<p>Well, here we are&#8230;another weekend in the hospital!  Hopefully they will get him back in balance and we will be able to have a couple days at home before we head back in on Wednesday!</p>
<p>Love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well&#8230;..Our morning started off with a nose bleed that wouldn&#8217;t stop. Immediately I knew Chris&#8217; red counts and platelet&#8217;s were low&#8230;we didn&#8217;t have to see the doctor to figure that much out.<br />
We got to the doctors office and had his blood tests done. Sure enough&#8230;he has no white cells,no red cells and no platelet&#8217;s. The crazy but wonderful part, is that he feels great!( aside form the nose bleed). So needless to say&#8230;NO chemo today! Dr. Sunnenburg would have given Chris his chemo today because he&#8217;s tough on Chris and likes to &#8216;beat him up&#8217; because Chris is young and resilient. But, we thought it was best that he have more time to recover before he got smacked again with something else. He&#8217;s had everything from shingles to mouth soars to nose bleeds and MORE ( that I won&#8217;t mention) in just one week. So, his body needs a break.</p>
<p>So we are scheduled first thing Monday morning for Chemo and then maybe back into the hospital on Wednesday for 4-5 days of more chemo (hyper-cvad part B with the new drug).</p>
<p>So, Thats all for now. We are planning on having a nice relaxing weekend&#8230;enjoy the weather and get ready for the week ahead of us. I&#8217;m going to go get him a steak for dinner tonight. He needs iron&#8230;so whatever it takes!!!!:) Chris is so excited because he never gets to eat steak&#8230;.poor guy!</p>
<p>Chris and I love all of the sweet messages, cards and flowers, fruit, and gifts. We feel so blessed to have all of you in our life. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts! We/he couldn&#8217;t get through this without all of you!!!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Last night was a good night.  We both slept well and woke up refreshed.  YEAH!!!!:)</p>
<p>Chris&#8217; blood counts are super low. He got his shot yesterday, so hopefully they will increase over the next couple of days. Tomorrow they will check his levels again, and if they are high enough they will proceed with his chemo protocol and administer a shot of Vincristine ( a tumor shrinking drug). Next Tuesday we will see Dr.Sunnenburg again so that he can evaluate the area where the lump was and we can make a decision on which direction we will go in. Next Tuesday will be a pivotal point in our journey.</p>
<p>I spoke with my my dear friend Cheryl&#8230;whose son went through the same treatment as Chris and had the same lymphoma also. She reassure me that the Stem Cell Transplant is SO doable and not too scary. I feel confidant that if this is the path we chose to take, that Chris will pull through just fine. It&#8217;s a remarkable technology that gives people a second chance at life&#8230;&#8217;Cancer Free&#8217;.<br />
I think that we are finally surrendering to the process and trusting our oncologist. Instead of resisting the things that sound scary and trying to control and question everything. Although I will always question everyone from nurses to doctors when I feel it is necessary. Dr. Sunnenberg is really incredible and we are so thankful for Paula and her husband for getting us on his schedule so quickly.</p>
<p>Overall Chris is doing well. He feels better and stronger everyday. We are just taking life one moment at a time and enjoying each other as much as possible. I love him so much and I cannot wait for to see him healthy and happy again soon!</p>
<p>Thank you for your prayers&#8230;we truly feel the love and support from everyone. It&#8217;s very moving&#8230;and we are touched by your kindness and sincerity.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Today was very emotional and heavy. We met with our oncologist this morning and he said he met with his colleges at MD Anderson and we basically have 3 options.</p>
<p>Option one&#8230;.<br />
Wait and watch in between this chemo treatment&#8230;make sure the lump does NOT grow back &#8230;..then hit it again with HIGH DOSE chemo as well as introduce a new drug, that is successful in treating aggressive lymphomas.</p>
<p>Option two&#8230;.<br />
Go to NCI..( National Cancer Institute) receive high dose chemo (even higher than he is receiving now) and receive an AUTO stem cell transplant. This is a procedure that takes 6 weeks&#8230;they extract Chris own stem cells&#8230;.kill the cancer then immediately give the cells back to Chris. This is often times called a &#8216;rebirth&#8217;. It basically cleanses the body of all cancerous cells and provides a clean slate.</p>
<p>Option three&#8230;<br />
Go to NCI. Receive high dose chemo. Extract Chris&#8217; sister, Audrey&#8217;s Stem cells and give them back to Chris. There is a 1 in 5 chance of her being a match. There is a 10% chance Chris&#8217; body could reject her cells ( Graph versus Host disease) and it could be fatal. But the good news is that if they are a match and his body accepts Audrey&#8217;s cells&#8230;it will breathe new life into Chris&#8217; body and Audrey&#8217;s healthy stem cells with fight Chris&#8217; cancer for him. ( this is called Graph versus Tumor).</p>
<p>So&#8230;here we are&#8230;playing the waiting game again. I am hoping that this thing does not grow back and that Chris can kick it once and for all.<br />
This has been 5 long months&#8230;7 chemo treatments&#8230;and a lot of tears and frustration. I pray that one day we have our victory in all of this.</p>
<p>Chris and I want to thank you for the beautiful messages you all of have left on our guest book. They bring us/him so much hope.</p>
<p>We are truly grateful for our friends and family and the friends of family who are praying for him. Your thoughts and prayers lift him up and provided a sense of peace in the face of this challenging situation.</p>
<p>We love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris told me last night that he felt like everything that the docs tell you &#8230;.you might experience during chemo&#8230;&#8230;he&#8217;s definitely had every symptom this time around. I feel so helpless because I can&#8217;t do anything to make him feel better. I picked up 5 prescriptions yesterday to alleviate the side effects of chemo&#8230;he&#8217;s never taken this much medicine in his life.<br />
Chris has been sleeping and resting a lot&#8230; which is the very BEST thing to do after such high doses of chemo. I have never seen him like this before. Each treatment gets worse&#8230;as far as feeling BAD goes.<br />
We are anxiously awaiting our appointment tomorrow with Dr.Sunnuberg. Can&#8217;t wait to see what he has to say and what he thinks of Chris&#8217; progress this time around. We pray that we find a solution and that he will not have to endure much more of this.<br />
He i going in for his shot today.  Maybe this will make him feel better and get his counts up.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Chris came home form the hospital around 3 pm and slept for about three hours then hung out with me for awhile then we went back to bed and slept all night. He says he feels really worn out. He is doing well aside from the soars in his mouth, but the doctor gave us this stuff called &#8216;magic mouthwash&#8217; that is supposed to help a lot.</p>
<p>Now for the exciting news&#8230;.The lump is GONE! I can not see it anymore AT ALL! The trick is for it to stay this way. Usually after chemo&#8230;I could still see and feel a residual layer under his skin that was like a flat tumor&#8230;almost &#8216;disc like&#8217;. But now it is almost concave in that area. I am so happy! I love to see him respond this way to chemo because it is really promising. We have an appointment with Dr. Sunnenberg and I can not wait for him to see this. I&#8217;m really curious what he is going to say about it all. Dr. Sunnenberg returned form MD. Anderson today and I am hoping he will have a plan for Chris that will knock him right into remission!!!!</p>
<p>Keep your fingers crossed!!!!</p>
<p>So&#8230;it&#8217;s back to work for both of us! I&#8217;m so happy we are home and that Chris is doing well. He gets his shot tomorrow to boost his blood cells and they will check his levels to make sure that he is doing alright. I will keep you all posted.</p>
<p>Love you guys!</p>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We had our favorite nurse last night. Her name is Nancy and she is AMAZING. Every nurse should take lessons from her because she truly has a passion for nursing. Nancy worked at a cancer facility in South Carolina and she worked in the lymphoma department&#8230;so, she knows SO much about what Chris is going through. She NEVER wakes him up in the middle of the night by talking his ear off at 2am ( you wouldn&#8217;t believe how many nurses do this)&#8230;she spoils him (and me) rotten with ice cream and warm blankets. She even showed up at our house last time, to check on Chris because he had such a rough morning before he was discharged. We love Nancy so much&#8230;she&#8217;s like family.</p>
<p>So, we are getting out of here today!YEA! Chris&#8217; last bag of chemo runs at 3 pm. He will be able to sleep in his own bed tonight and actually get solid sleep.<br />
He didn&#8217;t have any complications this time. Pheeew! Every time is different and we just never know what might happen. I think we have this nausea thing down pat, though. The trick is to just say your nauseous when the nurses ask&#8230; and keep the meds flowing. Better safe then sorry!</p>
<p>We are going to get through this&#8230;In fact&#8230;.we ARE getting through this! I told Chris one day we will look at each other and this will be a distant memory&#8230;and we will wonder how we got through it all&#8230;BUT we did!!!</p>
<p>We love you guys and thank you for all your support! We feel so blessed!</p>
<p>Love, Amy</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well kids&#8230;it&#8217;s just another day in the life of me. The Methotrexate I have been given is just about out of my body as I have been drinking a ton of fluids. The toughest thing about this 5 day period is the fact I feel caged. It&#8217;s yet another layer on feeling as if my life is completely on hold. I am just ready to be in remission and enjoying every moment with my beautiful wife. I am telling you this as fact&#8230;she is my cure. Everything that has progressed in the right direction is because of her. She asks about treatment that doctors eventually come to as a solution. She connected us with a brilliant doctor and his colleagues. The tumor has reduced significantly and I think this &#8216;B&#8217; portion of the Hyper CVAD treatment is the key. The &#8216;A&#8217; did not seem to work and is along the same lines as the old RChops that were a total waste in the beginning.</p>
<p>I have always conquered and learned from my past challenges and this is no different. The one thing I can take from this at this point is that there is no greater love than I experience from Amy every day. Other than that, I don&#8217;t feel I need any other life lessons out of this. I was living it to the fullest before, appreciative of every moment, and now that has been put on hold. If anything, hopefully others can see that even in the most fearful situation we all make our decision. I have come to love this part in life. I refuse to sit on the sidelines whether the outcome good or bad. I have made my decision and that is to stomp this into remission and get back to loving my wife at the deepest level and taking life on with utter success.</p>
<p>I love you all. Have a beautiful weekend.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Christopher</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">Well&#8230;.Chris got absolutely NO sleep last night. He had a very busy day/night. He had a lumbar puncture and a blood transfusion on top of all the chemo. The nurse came in about 50 times last night. My Dad and Aunt Anna came by this morning to check on us. We visited with them for about an hour and laughed a little about my dad and his funny little words he makes up. Chris&#8217; friend from college (Eric) came by last night and talked with Chris for awhile. Today Brooke (another college friend) will be coming by to visit. She is in town from Tallahassee and is in a Triathlon today. Chris is looking forward to seeing her&#8230;she was in our wedding and it&#8217;s been a while since they have seen each other.<br />
Our oncologist is still in Houston&#8230;but his partner came by this morning and said that there is another chemo regimen that they will most likely work Chris into. It contains two other drugs that Chris has never had before on top of the ones that he responds so well to.<br />
When he woke up this morning&#8230;I noticed that the lump on the side of his face was FLAT. Completely flat!!!! Now if we can get it to stay like this!!! Hopefully these two new drugs will kick the lymphoma&#8217;s butt!!! Our doctor said that the two new ones are VERY successful in treating aggressive lymphoma. I feel like we are getting closer to our answer.<br />
Chris will get to go outside today!  His blood counts look good, he&#8217;s eating well, and looks strong!</p>
<p>We are so grateful for all the support of our friends and family! You have no idea how much you comments and phone calls mean to us and especially to Chris!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Amy</p></div>

<div style="overflow: auto;">We had an appointment with our oncologist Dr. Sunnenburg Wednesday morning to show him how Chris responded to his last chemo treatment. We noticed a slight change in the lump and wanted him to see it and make a judgment call on whether this line of chemo is working. Dr. Sunnenberg decided to admit Chris right away to do the portion of the chemo regimen that has been so successful the first two times. This means Chris is a week ahead of schedule. His counts looked really good and he feels strong, so Dr. Sunnenberg wanted to seize the moment and &#8216;go for it&#8217;.<br />
The GREAT news is that Dr. Sunnenberg has an appointment at MD Anderson in Houston to meet with a LYMPHOMA specialist on Friday ( today). He will present Chris&#8217; case to this doctor in hopes of finding the perfect chemo regime&#8217;s to put him in remission!!!<br />
Now&#8230;being the computer savvy person that Chris is &#8230;he presented Dr. Sunneberg with a power point presentation of the pictures we have taken on this journey of Chris and his response to each treatment. We have documented everything!!!! Dr Sunnenberg was thrilled and is sending it to Emory University to our oncologist there as well as showing it at MD Anderson. We ask that everyone keep Chris in your thoughts. We are asking that the RIGHT answers come forth to get Chris into remission!!!<br />
Chris looks good&#8230;he feels good. This chemo kicks his butt for a few days after he returns home but then he is fine and back to normal ( well, as normal as you can be after getting tons of chemo dumped into your body)</p>
<p>Chris and I are so grateful for our friends and family for lifting us up in this situation.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Amy</p></div>
