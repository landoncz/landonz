<p><strong>**Hosted by amazing friends - </strong>Bryan Conner &amp; Hugo Cubias <em>as well as heart-filled contributions from other long time friends &amp; supporters of my journey.</em></p>
<p>May 2008 I was misdiagnosed with Non Hodgkin&#8217;s Diffused Large B Cell Lymphoma; Stage 1 Localized. July 2008 I was correctly diagnosed with Burkitt&#8217;s Lymphoma; Stage 1 Localized.<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2008/10/cureimage.jpg" rel="lightbox[1]"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-58" title="cureimage" src="../wp-content/uploads/2008/10/cureimage.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>I had a swollen Lymph node appear late November 2007. I spoke with multiple friends and family to hear it was pretty normal and I was probably fighting off something viral or bacterial. I decided to go about my business but watch it for any changes. It would occasionally get firm, but then elastic just as quick. A couple months went by and my wife Amy and I decided to see our physician. He agreed, it was something to keep an eye on but sometimes swollen lymph nodes can hang around for a while.</p>
<p>One weekend we took a mini vacation to see my sister Audrey, her husband Allen, and their adorable little girl April in Atlanta, Georgia. The drive was a short 5 hour period in the car. Something seriously went wrong. Within that time the swollen lymph node grew almost quadruple in size. I thought it was sinus problems but still needed Advil ALL weekend as my head was throbbing non stop. Returning home I immediately went to see the doctor. He put me on a very strong antibiotic. Thankfully, the swelling went down but the lymph node was still enlarged as it was before our trip. The plan was still to watch it. Upon lack of reduction in size I would be referred to an ENT Specialist. I eventually made my appointment with Dr. Kotlarz, a wonderful ENT Specialist in Pensacola, FL. His demeanor was a little direct and lacked emotion. I honestly felt like I was paying for minutes of his time but it was necessary to keep this on constant watch. He prescribed me a steroid instead of antibiotic this time.</p>
<p>The month of May was the turning point of my life. The lymph node area began to grow tremendously. My ENT doctor did a needle biopsy that returned no signs of a cancerous tumor so he gave me my options. Surgical removal, surgical removal, and surgical removal. I was too young to have to deal with any benign tumor growth. I made my appointment for May 23rd. I was nervous because there was a chance my facial nerves could be damaged in the process leaving part of my face paralyzed. I was ready to put this behind me.</p>
<p>May 23rd was finally here and with Amy and her family&#8217;s support I prepared myself for surgery. Not one and a half hours and Dr. Kotlarz came out of the operating room. He told Amy during the removal something did not look right so he sent a sample off to the Pathology department. He decided to end my surgery upon further tests. I woke up thinking the worst was over and I was on to a road of recovery. I slept for a while but noticed people stopping by randomly and whispering. When I finally awoke Amy came into our bedroom. I said, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the verdict?&#8221; My question was along the lines of nerve damage, if any what I would hear next would shake up my whole world. She said, &#8220;They had to stop the surgery because Dr. Kotlarz found you had Lymphoma&#8230;that&#8217;s cancer.&#8221; I cried immediately, but oddly enough snapped out of it pretty quick. I needed to know the next move. We had an appointment with Dr. Amin, an Oncologist with the Hope Medical Group. I couldn&#8217;t believe my wife had the burden on her shoulders to tell me I had cancer that weekend. It was the longest weekend of my entire life as we were waiting for the Pathology test results.</p>
<p>My meeting on Tuesday hit and my mom came down from Virginia to support us during some rigorous testing procedures. At first Dr. Amin seemed really compassionate and that she had a plan. I think we were all naive of the type of doctor to look for. Plus, my head was in excrutiating pain as the swelling was worse so time was a factor. Diffused Large B Cell was the verdict and we immediately started a protocol treatment called RChop. Amy&#8217;s dear friends were urging us to get a second opinion upon their own experiences with Pensacola Pathology department as they were known for misdiagnosing patients when it came to cancer. We took their concerns very seriously as these people have the means to go to the top institutes in America for the right answers. I underwent my first treatment of RChop with no idea what to expect. Within days my Lymphoma disappeared before my eyes. I faired extremely well without any real side effects from my chemotherapy treatment. I thought, I am not a number or compiled statistic and I will beat this with flying colors. Every one was amazed with the results of just one treatment. I was sure it would not be long before I was back in action.</p>
<p>Two and a half weeks passed and my next treatment was nearing. I noticed something very disturbing. Over a matter of one week my Lymphoma started growing back and in an odd cone shape. Amy was not happy and had a list of questions for me to ask Dr. Amin as she was researching my Lymphoma day and night. Our main concern became a second opinion. I felt a little nervous asking for one because I felt it might be demeaning to the Dr.&#8217;s professional assessment but Amy was sure to kick my butt over that because this was my life we were dealing with. I took the list of questions into my next appointment hoping for some clearity. Unfortunately, Amy had to work and probably could have pushed each question way better than I could.</p>
<p>During my appointment one thing I noticed was that Dr. Amin was very non-chalant about the turn of my Lymphoma. Also, when the question for a second opinion was presented she paused as if ego might have been building up. Her response was, &#8220;I feel our Pathology department is very competent and that a second opinion is not necessary.&#8221; I said, &#8220;So you don&#8217;t think they could have made a mistake considering my Lymphoma has come back?&#8221; She stared at me with a partial grin and said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t read between the lines and just took her best professional opinion as law. She explained we might move my treatments up one week to catch it early. Amy was not happy but felt we just needed to trust that we would be led in the right direction. I went in for my second treatment of RChop on a Thursday.</p>
<p>Exactly one week later my Lymphoma grew back AGAIN. This time I was extremely frustrated. Dr. Amin went out of town and did not even have the decency to leave me with one of her colleagues within the group. The whole weekend we were left with a million questions and NO answers. I called immediately that following Monday and explained my concerns to the nurses. Dr. Amin was still on vacation that Monday and would only be at another hospital to see other patients for a short period of time Tuesday. At no point did she think to call or schedule an appointment to see how I was doing in between treatments. I pushed, and pushed for an earlier appointment. Luckily, the nurses got in contact with her and got me in to see her Tuesday. We were on pins and needles. Amy and I went in completely frustrated. She passed me off as just a simple case of Refractory and that we need to start the process for a Stem Cell transplant at Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia as if we new what that meant. She kept us on a need to know basis and that approach was running thin.</p>
<p>We continued on with the next RChop treatment to bide us time before we met with the doctor at Emory. At this point my dad felt he needed to be here and support us as everything was uncertain and extremely scary. It was great to have my dad here but we were all riddled with questions. He eventually traveled to Atlanta to see the Oncologist I was assigned to in Emory with Amy and I. We walked into our appointment without expectation and found ourselves empowered. Dr. Flowers and his assistant mapped out my whole diagnosis and treatment schedule on a white board. He had another theory though about my Lymphoma. Based off what he knew and the fact I had not experienced the typical symptoms of Diffused Large B Cell Lymphoma that I could have a very aggressive rare lymphoma called Burkitt&#8217;s. Burkitt&#8217;s Lymphoma is normally found in small African children. It&#8217;s rare in the United States but if found early very treatable. From that point I was going to need another biopsy and PET Scan to make sure that we were still in early stages and if it was possibly Burkitt&#8217;s Lymphoma.</p>
<p>Amy and I were in a very uncomfortable situation. We did not feel right with our current Oncologist in Pensacola, Florida but also felt there were a lot of politics involved and had nowhere to turn. We did know that something still needed to be done in the meantime to keep my Lymphoma at bay so we met with Dr. Amin one more time. Amy really wanted another opinion on my old pathology slides. She had been researching so much, and to hear the possibility of a different lymphoma I wanted her to be at this meeting. This would decide whether she was working off ego, or true concern for my best interests. I think I might have set the tone the day of our meeting because when she asked how the Emory visit went I said, &#8220;It was very enlightening!&#8221; She kind of shook off my remark and proceeded to explore what was said. We gave her all of the griddy details. Amy once again asked, &#8220;Do you think we could send our original slides to the National Cancer Institute with the chance it could have been misdiagnosed?&#8221; She once again paused which was very strange. Then she explained it would take more time to do that and put my treatment on hold so she did not advise it. That was our answer. She was mixing ego in place of genuine concern. One thing was certain in our hearts, she was NOT our Oncologist anymore. I immediatelty called the nurses and demanded I get a copy of ALL records since being involved with the Hope Medical Group. Politics did start to play a factor and we were scared we would not have the help we needed locally.</p>
<p>Amy went to work one day and met a new client Paula that would change our life. They started talking and somehow got on the conversation of my illness, Emory, and Dr. Amin. She explained her relation to the best Oncologist in Pensacola. He was in high demand and booked solid. Not a day passed and I got a call from her husand who is a surgeon. He asked me a multitude of questions and offered to explain my situation to the very well known Dr. Sunnenberg. I literally wanted to cry. most people want Dr. Sunnenberg because he is a genius but he is in such high demand it&#8217;s rare to be able to see him in any short time frame. Not but one day later I got a call from his office staff to schedule an appointment! Amy and I felt we were on the right path and just filled with relief. In the meantime my Lymphoma was growing fast. I had my second biopsy, drove the sample to Emory and physically handed them to the right people at Emory&#8217;s Pathology department  for testing. It came back with some oddities so they decided to do a FISH Scan on my slides to either disprove the idea of Burkitt&#8217;s or confirm that I was Refractory to Diffused Large B Cell treatments. Interesting enough Dr. Amin called to say the local Pathology department concluded it was still Diffused Large B Cell&#8230;go figure.</p>
<p>It had been some time in between my last treatment and the second biopsy was given to Emory. Amy and I could not understand what was taking so long as my Lymphoma looked like it did the day of my original surgery. It was big. Something told me Amy and I had found our Oncologist. Our very first meeting Dr. Sunnenberg was educating us. He was all over the place but made total sense. When we explained we were waiting on a FISH Scan to come back and it had been way longer than they said it would take he immediately got on the phone and demanded to talk to Dr. Flowers at Emory. They discussed my case and both agreed I needed to be in treatment of some kind while we wait on the Pathology department. Two great minds set me on my journey of Hyper CVAD. A high dose treatment used for Burkitt&#8217;s Lymphoma patients but that would work even if my pathology report came back as something other than Burkitt&#8217;s.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of my new journey with Lymphoma as I was officially diagnosed correctly with Burkitt&#8217;s because of a few high profile genes in my blood cells known to this lymphoma. Four treatments later I am faced with many decisions to make and no real conclusion to this craziness.</p>

						<div class='body'><p>Even though I have never met you, my heart goes out to you and Amy. If theres anyone I would want by my side for this incredible journey, Its Amy. She is a wonderful person and Im sure a great inspiration to you as a wife. I sorta went through a similar situation with my brother 2 years ago. At age 32 he developed a rare disease found in African American males know as Sarcodosis. This was an incredibly tough time for all of us as you can imagine but with our support and his strong will, he has gotten through it and is doing well. I truly belive with the support you have you will do the same. If there is anything my wife, family, and I can do for the 2 of you, please never be afraid to ask. STAY STRONG!</p>

						<div class='body'><p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know me but by the time you finish reading this you will know that I genuinely love you and care for you because of the love that your sister Audrey has for you.  I am confident that because of the tremendous amount of love that your family and people like myself have for you, positive things will happen to strenghten you and carry you through this season in your life.  I will always say a prayer for you each day and think positive thoughts about you and your journey through this illness.  Audrey has described you as a confident, optimistic, incredible human being so you have to live up to that so, let your website reflect who you are inside, tell us about you, who you are and what you plan to do next summer with your beautiful wife.  By the way, you are incredibly handsome! LOL!<br />
Take Care, I&#8217;ll visit again soon if that&#8217;s okay?<br />
Your new friend,<br />
Marsha :o)</p>

						<div class='body'><p>Chris -<br />
Your sister Audrey sent me a link to your site. April and my daughter Christina are the best of friends. Thank you for sharing your story and your struggle with the proper diagnosis. I too, had a similar struggle with being properly diagnosed with pseudo tumor cerebri over 10 years ago. It&#8217;s frustrating and unfair, but never lose faith.<br />
Last year, I trained with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and walked my first half marathon raising more than $3800 for research and a cure to blood cancers. It was a struggle and, at times painful, but nothing compared to those who fight cancer every day. If you have not already, I would suggest contacting the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society for more information and support for you and your family <a href="http://www.lls.org/hm_lls" rel="nofollow">http://www.lls.org/hm_lls</a>. I walked to honor family and friends affected by cancer and next time I will walk for you.</p>

						<div class='body'><p>Chris, your story came to me through a good friend from Woodbridge Senior High School.  I just wanted to say after reading your brief but, powerful story that I&#8217;m so proud to have had the chance to meet someone with your strength.  I know everything will work itself out especially with the support of your loved ones and having faith in GOD!  You are a champion of a man for going through the madness and still staying positive and optimistic.  I will be praying for you and your family to continue to beat this as you currently are my friend.  I remember one great thing about that stands out about Chris Blok when we in high school&#8230;..your attitude!  Attitude is just as important as any &#8220;expert diagnosis&#8221; and I know that because you possess a wonderful one that you will conquer this sickness once and for all.  I don&#8217;t need to tell you to stay strong and what not but, I will say this&#8230;.you are a unique individual that will inspire others to never give up and to always continue to move forward.  You have another person/family pushing for you and praying for yours.  Thank you for sharing your story and for enlightening me to the &#8220;beaucracy crap&#8221; that is involved in something like this.  My future mother in law is going through a similar situation in obtaining disability for lupus and liver cancer among other things that she has at this current moment.  I&#8217;ll be stopping by periodically to check up on updates.  Keep the faith and always know that attitude truely is everything!</p>
<p>Sincere regards and love,<br />
                                          The Rodriguez Family.</p>

I work with Audrey. At 39, my wife was diagnosed late with an aggressive form of breast cancer. After many operations, frustrations over inefficient health care system, she recoverd. Now at 51, she has beaten the disease. You will too! Stay involved, seek second opinions, and never give up. </p>

						<div class='body'><p>Chris,</p>
<p>Your website was given to me by Nubia, who is the data clerk at Ransom Middle School where I teach. I really recommend that you  call Dr&#8217;s. Katherine and Scott Crafton and ask them about a new mac hine they just received at their chiropractic office in Daphne , Ala. The cost will  be minimal and there is a great chance the effect will be very favorable.I cannot begin to tell you how much confidence I have in them. If you are interested in knowing more either email me or, better yet, call them at 1-215-625-3331. You have nothing to loose and everything to gain.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />

						<div class='body'><p>Hi Christopher,<br />
We don&#8217;t know each other. I was referred to your website by (Col.) Jim Williams. Jim and I have served together on the board of the Intercultural Cancer Council for more than 10 years. I just wanted you to know that I&#8217;m a survivor of three different primary cancers. I was given five years to live and on May 22, 2009, I&#8217;ll celebrate my 23rd year of survival. God is good and prayers are powerful. I will be praying daily for you and your family. I, too, was misdiagnosed with my second cancer, allowing it to metastasize to many places. It&#8217;s been almost nine years since that time and I&#8217;m cancer free. Hang tough and never give up. I&#8217;m in Jacksonville, Florida and will be here cheering you on.</p>
<p>Keep the faith.</p>

						<div class='body'><p>Christopher,</p>
<p>Your story was forwarded to me from a co-worker because she was so touched, and also so concerned that such errors or lack of diligence can result in the on-going problems that you&#8217;ve had.  I have Stage 4 Colon cancer that progressed to my liver.  I was very, very fortunate that despite my gastrointerologist&#8217;s initial failure to diagnose the cancer (or even conduct the appropriate tests to learn I had a huge tumor in my colon that progressed through the colon wall into my uterus), I was referred to an outstanding colon surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and excellent follow-up care with my oncologist, Dr. Dissanakaye at Sacred Heart Oncology over at the West Florida Hospital campus.  Dr. &#8220;D,&#8221; as we call him, has actually called me several times well after 5:00 in the evening after re-reviewing my charts and history so that he can ensure that he provides the best care possible, learning from past experiences or reactions to treatments I had, and applying all that he knows to my case.  He has called other specialists to discuss my case and he, himself, referred me to MD Anderson Cancer Clinic (the #1 clinic in the US) for a second opinion and to ensure that he was doing everything he could do for me.  I underwent chemo for nearly a year, as well as two surgeries, and was happily &#8220;clean&#8221; for about 4 and a half months, then unfortunately the cancer returned, and I&#8217;m undergoing chemo (a different, stronger kind) again under Dr. D&#8217;s care.  I&#8217;ve been so fortunate in finding Dr. D and knowing I have a doctor who genuinely cares for my well-being, not only physically, but mentally &#8212; he takes the time to really talk to me and find out how I&#8217;m handling everything &#8212; my job (I still work because I think it&#8217;s vital, if you can, to try to keep everything as &#8220;normal&#8221; as possible), etc.  Dr. D is always, always running behind on appointment day, but I never care, because I know that the reason he&#8217;s behind is because he takes that extra time with each of his patients.  He also insisted on another biopsy when my radiologist &#8220;missed&#8221; the liver tumors and gave me a clean/no cancer report &#8212; Dr. D knew that couldn&#8217;t be right because of my blood indicators (essentially off the charts) and called the radiologist himself to schedule an immediate second biopsy, which found the cancer.</p>
<p>I am just so very sorry that you had to go through such pain, anxiety, and frustration because of the ego of your doctor &#8212; I&#8217;m aware of that problem in the medical field and it is a constant, utter disappointment to learn of yet another doctor putting themselves and their ego before their patient.  I am glad that you finally recognized what she was doing and found better, more professional and ethical doctors to treat you.</p>
<p>God bless you, Christopher.  Stay strong in this fight.  You have a wonderful family and &#8220;army&#8221; of support.  And know that whatever happens, you have been a true warrior, in every since of the word, and though I&#8217;ve never met you, I am enormously proud of you.  </p>
