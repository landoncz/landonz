		<description>I dont know you very well, I heard about your situation, and I have been praying for your situation. Never underestimate the power of God, and that prayer works. My friends mother has stage 4 cancer and it has spread all throughout her body, many people have been praying for her, and just yesterday her scan, came back completley clear of cancer! Miracles can occur!</description>

		<description>Christopher,

Your story was forwarded to me from a co-worker because she was so touched, and also so concerned that such errors or lack of diligence can result in the on-going problems that you've had.  I have Stage 4 Colon cancer that progressed to my liver.  I was very, very fortunate that despite my gastrointerologist's initial failure to diagnose the cancer (or even conduct the appropriate tests to learn I had a huge tumor in my colon that progressed through the colon wall into my uterus), I was referred to an outstanding colon surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and excellent follow-up care with my oncologist, Dr. Dissanakaye at Sacred Heart Oncology over at the West Florida Hospital campus.  Dr. "D," as we call him, has actually called me several times well after 5:00 in the evening after re-reviewing my charts and history so that he can ensure that he provides the best care possible, learning from past experiences or reactions to treatments I had, and applying all that he knows to my case.  He has called other specialists to discuss my case and he, himself, referred me to MD Anderson Cancer Clinic (the #1 clinic in the US) for a second opinion and to ensure that he was doing everything he could do for me.  I underwent chemo for nearly a year, as well as two surgeries, and was happily "clean" for about 4 and a half months, then unfortunately the cancer returned, and I'm undergoing chemo (a different, stronger kind) again under Dr. D's care.  I've been so fortunate in finding Dr. D and knowing I have a doctor who genuinely cares for my well-being, not only physically, but mentally -- he takes the time to really talk to me and find out how I'm handling everything -- my job (I still work because I think it's vital, if you can, to try to keep everything as "normal" as possible), etc.  Dr. D is always, always running behind on appointment day, but I never care, because I know that the reason he's behind is because he takes that extra time with each of his patients.  He also insisted on another biopsy when my radiologist "missed" the liver tumors and gave me a clean/no cancer report -- Dr. D knew that couldn't be right because of my blood indicators (essentially off the charts) and called the radiologist himself to schedule an immediate second biopsy, which found the cancer.

I am just so very sorry that you had to go through such pain, anxiety, and frustration because of the ego of your doctor -- I'm aware of that problem in the medical field and it is a constant, utter disappointment to learn of yet another doctor putting themselves and their ego before their patient.  I am glad that you finally recognized what she was doing and found better, more professional and ethical doctors to treat you.

God bless you, Christopher.  Stay strong in this fight.  You have a wonderful family and "army" of support.  And know that whatever happens, you have been a true warrior, in every since of the word, and though I've never met you, I am enormously proud of you.

		<description>Amy - I am so sorry to hear that Chris has lost his fight. I work with Audrey and I am sure you are all devastated to lose such a strong and remarkable young man. Someone once wrote "As you comprehend this profound loss, let yourself cry knowing each tear is a note of love rising to the heavens..." Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.
God Bless You - Renee</description>

		<description>Hi Christopher,
We don't know each other. I was referred to your website by (Col.) Jim Williams. Jim and I have served together on the board of the Intercultural Cancer Council for more than 10 years. I just wanted you to know that I'm a survivor of three different primary cancers. I was given five years to live and on May 22, 2009, I'll celebrate my 23rd year of survival. God is good and prayers are powerful. I will be praying daily for you and your family. I, too, was misdiagnosed with my second cancer, allowing it to metastasize to many places. It's been almost nine years since that time and I'm cancer free. Hang tough and never give up. I'm in Jacksonville, Florida and will be here cheering you on.

Keep the faith.
