            	My company, Charlotte Harbor Marine at Burnt Store Marina, provides marine service
            	to over 500 vessels in wet slips and hundreds more that are dry docked. Burnt Store
            	Marina is the largest marina on the west coast of Florida, and my company is the sole
            	provider of marine service at this location. As one of the busiest marine service
            	centers in Florida, we process thousands of dollars in credit card transactions each
            	month; our processing fees are a huge cost of doing business, especially with the large
            	average purchase amount.</p>

            	One Source Payments promptly provided me with a detailed analysis of my current
            	statement, and offered us a revised rate plan which is saving us hundreds, literally, 
            	each month in processing fees. Also our credit card terminal and software was very
            	out of date, and One Source replaced and updated our equipment at no cost,
            	and is providing us with detailed reporting to help us reconcile our bank account.</p>

            	happier with their service. I would highly recommend One Source Payments to anyone
            	who is seriously interested in saving money and getting stellar service.
